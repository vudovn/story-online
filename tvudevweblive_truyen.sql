There is also a girl who looks at me with tears of joy running down her cheeks. She smiles at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「Ahh, the Spirits are being released&hellip;&hellip; The colors are returning to the world&hellip;&hellip; Thank you very much&hellip;&hellip;!!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I think about it, it was surely a long journey. As various memories scroll through my mind and fill my chest with pleasant warmth, I leap into the air in the universal gesture of victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「Finally, I beat your sorry ass~~~!!!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use the Fighting Skill &ldquo;Punishment Drop&rdquo;, a skill that for some strange reason (or a really specific setting) was mandatory to have if you wanted to defeat the true form of the Last Boss in this game, to hit the girl straight in the face&hellip;&hellip; The girl, Fucking Bitch &ldquo;Fairlia&rdquo; (or the Heroine as some people would call her) is sent into the air while spinning magnificently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since that was a story cutscene playing right now the girl suffered no damage whatsoever. The story progresses to its finale and the way it was doing that could only be described as the horror mixed with a nostalgia trip. There were some grand scenes unfolding accompanied by pompous BGM playing, a mixture that only total masochistic perverts would want to sit through until the very end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「Why is it that the only weapon that&rsquo;s capable of damaging the Last Boss hits like a wet noodle!? It takes three times as long to do some decent damage using this thing! Even unarmed does more damage than that! Isn&rsquo;t that weird that such a joke weapon is required to kill the boss in the first place!? And Fairkus, where did you go, you useless support!? Why are you even here if you&rsquo;re not doing anything!? Begone from this house, evil spirits begone from this house!!! Or salt you shall get!!!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「It surely was an arduous journey, but travelling with everyone was certainly fun&hellip;&hellip;!!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2251606319\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!8\" data-google-query-id=\"CLKWs76i2YwDFW-j2AUdkVoDzQ\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_7\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_7\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=2251606319&amp;adk=564636943&amp;adf=972325989&amp;pi=t.ma~as.2251606319&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693691&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-001%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693691445&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=306&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=915343404635&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=1859&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C42532523%2C95345038%2C95353420%2C95357877%2C95356808%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=4034129046492051&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2F%3Ftab%3Dtable_contents%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawJqxcpleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHjHCumJ1UzZr_iAWIPKXGUouznGpz88qOjSmpkCDe5VpKB0RPnbk0-LPPbX9_aem_YiMhsWafAwDat3Pe_Ocz-Q&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=8&amp;uci=a!8&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=32\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>「You call this fun!? The whole scenario and the side quests were all centered around you!? Isn&rsquo;t that weird!?」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game more often than not made me want to throw my controller against the wall, so I don&rsquo;t know about calling this &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. But since I was a completionist and started the game, I wanted to see this through to the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fairlia Chronicles Online ~Prayer of the Spirit Princess ~&rdquo; is the remake of the blockbuster RPG game that was released in the early days of VRRPG, and if I had to describe it in one sentence I would call it the epitome of a &ldquo;Shitty Game&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is by no means an exaggeration on my end. The NPCs are flat and their dialogues are boring. The Mobs are just your generic monsters and demons without any spin to them. Not to mention bugs like the party members who cast recovery magic on the enemies or use the elemental attacks against the enemies who embody said elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About ninety percent of the storyline can be described using the following formula: &ldquo;The Heroine presents the Player with some sort of a problem. Heroine somehow manages to make the problem even worse than it was. Somebody important dies because of it. Players solves the problem. Somehow it all turns out to be the working of the Evil Gods. Defeat the Evil Gods and restore peace to the world.&rdquo; Of course, along the way you will also learn that the Heroine is somehow connected to the Last Boss and the True Evil it usually represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are also your typical game clich&eacute;s such as: traps that explode every single time you walk through a tile corresponding to it, pitfalls right before the Last Boss chamber, the Last Boss that has three additional phases and forms to his fight if the Heroine is in the party (without her there would be only one phase and a different, &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; ending to be seen) etc, etc. &hellip;&hellip; So many bugs. It&rsquo;s kinda funny, because that&rsquo;s exactly how the offline era used to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there was any redeeming quality this game had to it, it was the fact that in the span of three minutes in between beating the Last Boss and credits rolling, you could attack the Heroine however you like without any real consequences. It was sort of hidden gem like that. By the way, this secret scene (called &ldquo;The Most Rewarding Three Minutes Ever&rdquo;) was only available to you if you&rsquo;ve defeated the boss with the favor meter maxed out for the Heroine, which was only possible if you&rsquo;ve completed every single side quest that was in the game. Another oddly specific function that only the biggest of Massive Masochists could force themselves to accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sudden difficulty spikes of encountered enemies. Shitty scenario. Bugs which sometimes could make gameplay unbearable. &ldquo;Fairlia Chronicles Online&rdquo; had all of the above elements of the unholy trinity of game development, which in turn earned it a completely new title in some circles: &ldquo;Shit Chronicles Online&rdquo;. I managed to withstand ten whole days with it before eventually wanted to stop playing, but then I decided to suffer through the rest of it and eventually cleared it in the next twenty four hours. After that my mind was full of the strangest mixture of feelings, like exhilaration mixed with relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5999279639\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!9\" data-google-query-id=\"CNSTs76i2YwDFWaZ2AUds0kpfg\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_8\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_8\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=5999279639&amp;adk=2134429683&amp;adf=452700094&amp;pi=t.ma~as.5999279639&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693691&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-001%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693691445&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=306&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693274%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=915343404635&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=2857&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C42532523%2C95345038%2C95353420%2C95357877%2C95356808%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=4034129046492051&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2F%3Ftab%3Dtable_contents%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawJqxcpleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHjHCumJ1UzZr_iAWIPKXGUouznGpz88qOjSmpkCDe5VpKB0RPnbk0-LPPbX9_aem_YiMhsWafAwDat3Pe_Ocz-Q&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=9&amp;uci=a!9&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=39\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, it was like serving your sentence in jail and being able to leave after a few years, only to be able to see the vast blue sky stretching before your eyes without being surrounded by high walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was like being able to find the long lost contact lenses that you dropped somewhere in the middle of the vast desert&hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is only one thing I can say with utmost certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「I&rsquo;m not playing such a shitty game ever again!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I proclaim something like that while watching the end credits rolling in front of my eyes, all the while feeling a certain kind of accomplishment spreading through my chest.</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 09:08:35', '2025-04-15 09:08:35'),

Hence the Players are free to live however they choose in the game, whether it would be going full on fantasy mode in the Middle Ages setting or to bring the elements of Sci-Fi and advanced weaponry to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its ratings are also very high, with Players holding the game in high regard, and the reviews can&rsquo;t get enough of it, unlike &ldquo;Shit Chronicles Online&rdquo; which was bombing in the reviews so much that it was a miracle how it managed to survive for so long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「I feel it would be rude to put the box on the same shelf as &ldquo;Shit Chronicles Online&rdquo; and other shitty games.」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a game called &ldquo;Cosmo Buster&rdquo; in my collection, an infamous shitty game from the FPS genre where the enemies were respawning infinitely and could pull a &ldquo;360 no scope&rdquo; on you without any problem, accompanied by obligatory overblown story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a game called &ldquo;Thrilling Farming Simulator&rdquo;. As the name implies, it is a simulation game where you cultivate crops and livestock at the local ranch at your own leisure.

How did this happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, there was a reason for this, trust me. It was all for the sake of getting a good start. I examined the game&rsquo;s manual and it looks like you could sell the initial equipment you were starting with. Mercenaries had the mercenary class items and equipment, which were going to sell for quite a bit of money. It was able to double or even triple the amount of money you were going to start with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money was sure to be an important element of this game. As a full dive game, even after receiving a quest you had to go and do anything yourself, without any kind of shortcuts or fast travel, so completing quests was rather hard and time consuming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My playstyle usually revolved around maneuverability and using strong weapons rather than fitting myself into armors, hence I was always selling it first&hellip;&hellip; However, walking around half-naked while looking like the protagonist of &ldquo;Shit Chronicles Online&rdquo; was pretty embarrassing in its own right&hellip;&hellip; so I decided to wear a mask on my face, one that would resemble a bird&rsquo;s beak (&ldquo;Mask of Bird&rsquo;s Eye&rdquo;) and that would give me a slight boost to perception and eyesight. It was one of the options available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2798401223\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!8\" data-google-query-id=\"CI_jruei2YwDFUmF2AUd1mUI9g\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_7\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_7\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=2798401223&amp;adk=1918303987&amp;adf=3881259009&amp;pi=t.ma~as.2798401223&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693777&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-003%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693776725&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=146&amp;idt=178&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=4905729005656&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=3607&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C42531706%2C95331833%2C95353450%2C95354562%2C95357877%2C95356808%2C95357716%2C95340252%2C95340254&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=2615520904772974&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-002%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=8&amp;uci=a!8&amp;btvi=8&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=621\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>「This is&hellip;&hellip; No, no, no!

The small details varied from game to game, but the overall premise was more or less the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「First of all, I need to understand my current situation.」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I say that I open the status screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PN: Sanraku<br />\r\nLV: 1<br />\r\nJob: Mercenary (Dual Wielding, Swords)<br />\r\n9000 Mani<br />\r\nHP (Health Points): 30<br />\r\nMP (Magic Points) : 10<br />\r\nSTM (Stamina): 20<br />\r\nSTR (Strength): 10<br />\r\nDEX (Dexterity): 15<br />\r\nAGI (Agility): 10<br />\r\nTEC (Technique): 15<br />\r\nVIT (Vitality): 1 (2)<br />\r\nLUC (Luck): 30</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SKILLS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash; Spin Slash<br />\r\n&ndash; Knuckle Rush</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equipment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right Hand: Mercenary Blade<br />\r\nLeft Hand: Mercenary Blade<br />\r\nHead: Mask of Bird&rsquo;s Eye (VIT +2)<br />\r\nTorso: None<br />\r\nLegs: None<br />\r\nFeet: None<br />\r\nAccessory: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5999279639\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!5\" data-google-query-id=\"CNaIjvqi2YwDFVICgwMdp9UDxQ\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_4\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_4\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=5999279639&amp;adk=2134429683&amp;adf=452700094&amp;pi=t.ma~as.5999279639&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693816&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-004%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693816517&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=222&amp;idt=150&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=6650442084246&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=2857&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C95353930%2C95357878%2C95356808%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=2858199145816633&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-003%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;cms=2&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=153\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paper thin defenses and extraordinary good luck.

In some games weaker monsters would die even when the slightest contact with the weapon or body of the player was made, but in this case there was no damage being calculated for that action of mine. However, the physics seemed to be working fine and the goblin landed on the ground face first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「How about a double strike&hellip;&hellip; Onto the ribs!」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「Gyaaah!?」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since it was virtual reality the action itself was greatly simplified to just two blunt hits that didn&rsquo;t really dealt any damage. So for a little while I was using this here goblin to try out various things I learned in other VR shitty games, wanting to see if I would be able to recreate the same actions in ShanFro as well. When I finally cut the goblin with my sword there is a large wound on its stomach, but instead of blood a geyser of red pixels shoots forth instead of blood. The goblin&rsquo;s HP bar continued to decrease and eventually it reached zero, forcing it to dissolve into a mass of small polygons and eventually disappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first when the monsters would die players needed to ransack their bodies for drop items, but after it was deemed too graphic, it was a general consensus that the dropped items would be left in the field after the monster&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the dawn of the VR technology there was this serious rant that &ldquo;Video games distorts the sense of values in young people&rdquo;.

I had my own matters which I needed to attend to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"2251606319\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!8\" data-google-query-id=\"CMn8_ZSj2YwDFfdfDwIdINMvsQ\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_7\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_7\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=2251606319&amp;adk=564636943&amp;adf=972325989&amp;pi=t.ma~as.2251606319&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693873&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-005%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693872855&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=235&amp;idt=172&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=2536243661838&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=1787&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C95332925%2C95353420%2C95353451%2C95354564%2C95357877%2C95356808%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3300411432638623&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-004%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=8&amp;uci=a!8&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=176\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>「Now this is quite the predicament&hellip;&hellip; One that I wasn&rsquo;t able to anticipate at all&hellip;&hellip;」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About two hours later I decided to organize my equipment after doing some more grinding. And since I was hunting for monsters at the edge of the nearby forest I decided to climb onto a tree before opening the menu, since there was always a possibility that the monsters could attack me while I was still on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is then that I encountered two major problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first one would be the weight of the equipment. It seems that whatever was too large for me to carry would be stored in my inventory, but when the weight of the inventory passed a certain amount, my movements would suffer a negative buff because of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far I have collected twelve items, four of which were pieces of armor and others were basic goblin weapons. And when I was placing the ninth Goblin Hatchet in my inventory, I could already feel that my movements were starting to slow down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Goblins, I encountered some other monsters as well, like for example the pig-headed Orcs taken straight out of a Dark Fantasy setting, some small local fauna like piglets or wolves, but there were also rarer monsters such as Vorpal Bunny, which was a larger, bipedal monster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vorpal Bunny proved itself to be a little more of a challenge from Goblins and Orcs, but at the end of the day it was just a rabbit: it may have critted more than other mobs, but once you got used to its attack patterns, it was a pretty easy opponent to deal with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the weapon it drops, which apparently had a five percent chance of spawning upon its death, &ldquo;Vorpal Chopper&rdquo;, was a rather solid weapon for the beginner zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5999279639\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!9\" data-google-query-id=\"CMjy_pSj2YwDFfBXDwIdOSs2lw\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_8\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_8\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=5999279639&amp;adk=2134429683&amp;adf=452700094&amp;pi=t.ma~as.5999279639&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744693873&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-005%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744693872858&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=239&amp;idt=180&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504100101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D2866bc2e90ef589f%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MZJACJoe2L3-LbLxHGKfExuw-Y61Q&amp;gpic=UID%3D0000109fcc9ed97a%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DALNI_MYMiu2FDS-_AnyTiWxU5ciKSufRGQ&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Db7c16eddc816c97c%3AT%3D1744692868%3ART%3D1744693692%3AS%3DAA-AfjZGlIQDT3K5bUpwaZn3B8th&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=2536243661838&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=2569&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C95332925%2C95353420%2C95353451%2C95354564%2C95357877%2C95356808%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3300411432638623&amp;tmod=1567802133&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fshangrila-frontier-shitty-games-hunter-challenges-godly-game%2Fshangrila-frontier-chapter-004%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=9&amp;uci=a!9&amp;btvi=5&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=185\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing it to my initial mercenary weapons, its stats were better all across the board and it held an additional effect of boosting one&rsquo;s critical damage a little bit.

Despite all of that there was still a guy who was fiddling with his phone, who seemingly has not made any connections.

Silence, be quiet, shut up you normies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh? Something is&hellip;here?&hellip;Coming? What is this feeling? Wait&hellip;huh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classroom floor began to shine, a circle and words combined with some geometric figure looking thing emits light&hellip;&hellip;wait, a magic formation? It&rsquo;s a magic formation. Ah&hellip;this is that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a doubt. On the contrary, if this was some surprise math test, I would be more surprised at my math teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time that thought came into my head, my body was already moving.

Ah, if a book about this was released then it would be interesting, I&rsquo;ll buy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As things are like that, I continue crawling through the attic.

I wouldn&rsquo;t want it to be a spiritual world or a horror world either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with the magic formation, it&rsquo;s probably not a Sci-Fi world?

Let&rsquo;s also bring out salt, a plate, and a cup. Of course, it&rsquo;s Villager A-san goods. Did this person actually stay in the village?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Place a frying pan on a bonfire and heat until smoke appears. Put shredded minced meat and thick slices of mushrooms onto the pan and then fry. Add a small amount of water when a brown color appears and cover with a lid. Shake the pan carefully to prevent burning, steam until the water is gone, and salt lightly to enhance the taste. Mmm, it smells good, so far the only ingredients are dried meat from the item bag and mushrooms from the mushroom forest. And the only seasoning is Mr. A&rsquo;s salt, the stock will run out sooner or later. Meat and fish, and what else you can get in the forest, as far as I saw yesterday, it was a mushroom forest. There may be a bamboo shoot village somewhere. &hellip;Don&rsquo;t start a war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To fetch water, I went outside, since I was here, I used clairvoyance to examine the surrounding area. It seems that there is no bamboo rattan. The war was evaded, but obtaining the bamboo shoot seems impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think about what to do from now on while eating. Securing food and housing will be the top priority, and the rest is safety and measures against demons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, this cave is probably fine as a living space. I have a tent so it may be okay to move around, but it is safer to use a cave. A cave in which I can enclose myself within is also wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If food in this area runs out, I&rsquo;ll consider moving out, food and safety is my first priority. Hmm? Normally, the adventure begins, but I&rsquo;m already enclosing myself from the outside world? If so, will I soon stop working? As expected, different world skills are scary!<br />\r\nIn this way, I entered the forest and started collecting mushrooms, and proceeded while searching with Appraisal. I passed through downstream yesterday, so today I will try to go upstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mushrooms are common and sometimes I find medicinal plants. I try not to approach anything that has any sign of being dangerous. I proceed through the forest while picking up firewood, wood, and vines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, normally these kinds of things have standard patterns, at first, you should live in a castle or something, but it&rsquo;s really a survival countryside life! Already in a forest without ever being kicked out of the castle! Moreover, there are 0 people other than me, the whole story is being told by me! Is this the summoning of a different world? What is the difference between this story and the Robinsons family transfer job?<br />\r\n(1.

Goblin-san, the weakest of the weakest, the small fish of the small fish, it&rsquo;s ridiculous if you can&rsquo;t beat it. Depending on the story, even a child can beat it &hellip;Is how it should be but it&rsquo;s somewhat strong? And there are two of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you&rsquo;re weak, defeat Goblins and raise your Lv, which is the basics. At first, it&rsquo;s a goblin or slime, is how it should be but their status is higher than expected, their strength is stronger than mine&hellip;can I win? No, I will be stuck if I can not beat the goblin. I will be fighting them one day as long as I enter the forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, I have the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. If I were to be suddenly attacked, I would be surprised and would be unable to do anything. The party which controls the element of surprise is overwhelmingly advantageous, you can aim to destroy each individual one by one, you can also choose an advantageous location, giving the advantage of terrain, you can even choose the timing, it is an absolute opportunity. If you can win, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is HP and ViT, and PoW, if you think only by the numbers, based on me whose stats are all 10, HP is 4 times, ViT is about 2.5 times? That means I have to attack 10 times more than the goblin. If I consider PoW&rsquo;s 2x, it&rsquo;s 20 times, so I can&rsquo;t win unless I land more than 20 hits per one hit.<br />\r\nOn the other hand, my HP is 10, Goblin&rsquo;s PoW is around 20, which means I will be out with a single blow. Which means I have to land 10 hits without getting hit once. It is a number that cannot be achieved by surprise attacks alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SpE and DeX are about the same, so I can&rsquo;t overwhelm them with speed either. The only advantages I have are InT and LuK, InT which is 10 times more and LuK which is incomprehensibly more. I might be able to win with InT if it was intelligence, but it&rsquo;s meaningless if it&rsquo;s magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, there is also that wooden stick with an attack power of &ldquo;?&rdquo; The opponent also has a club, but it&rsquo;s the same because I&rsquo;m done in one hit anyway. On the contrary, it can be said that it is advantageous if their speed is slowed by that heavy club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, if you aim at the back of the head or the neck from behind, it may cause more damage than other places. If I get a double bonus, it&rsquo;s 5 hits, the value of a surprise attack is probably high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"9746952951\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!6\" data-google-query-id=\"CO_l2raS2owDFWGH6QUdL6EhgQ\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_5\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_5\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=9746952951&amp;adk=3510032111&amp;adf=2613040719&amp;pi=t.ma~as.9746952951&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744723740&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-1%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744723739298&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=122&amp;idt=408&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504140101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D01025ce41beeef37%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MZ2NCoeUPoOY_1yJ1hcKIcaTyADGA&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010a012dba8ca%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MYRL0kqEbb0pK7vrEL5ZMwwD40Z_w&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc538dd61eebec506%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DAA-AfjblR72zy6EtY-LQ3hUu2Odz&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=6790561340385&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=21&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=3681&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C42532523%2C95353929%2C95354564%2C31091740%2C95357878%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=2530984012974094&amp;tmod=1899943773&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-1-part-5%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=6&amp;uci=a!6&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=1000\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as I don&rsquo;t know how reliable the numbers projected on the status are, an experiment is required, the experiment known as real-life combat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you try it, you will understand, but if you do not try you cannot understand, you can do it if it&rsquo;s possible, but when it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s dangerous.

By the time Goblin B arrives, even if Goblin A is not dead, he will not be in a condition to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goblin B rushes in while swinging its club, its swings are large, but unexpectedly hard to avoid.

I landed a hit on its throat before dodging to avoid a counter, but the counter never came.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I move a bit of distance away to adjust my breath.

Then I take their clubs as my loot before washing my face with river water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was more tired mentally than physically.

I don&rsquo;t know if magic can improve with practice, but if I can utilize it somehow in combat, then it will improve my combat ability by a great amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it was possible, I&rsquo;d want to settle all combat with long-distance attacks, but if my level does not rise, it would be impossible. To raise my level, I have to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll try a fire-like-spell with [Temperature] and [Fire magic], but with [Temperature] magic, the fire accumulates very slowly, fire magic can make fireballs but they are small and fly only a short distance, at most 2-3 meters. If you want the spell to travel, you need to concentrate a lot and it will be difficult to pull off in actual battle. That being said, it&rsquo;s fun, so I&rsquo;ll practice a little more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5999279639\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!9\" data-google-query-id=\"CI_bk8qS2owDFVdFwgUdu5oF1g\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_8\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_8\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=5999279639&amp;adk=2134429683&amp;adf=452700094&amp;pi=t.ma~as.5999279639&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744723781&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-2%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744723769220&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=239&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504140101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D01025ce41beeef37%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MZ2NCoeUPoOY_1yJ1hcKIcaTyADGA&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010a012dba8ca%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MYRL0kqEbb0pK7vrEL5ZMwwD40Z_w&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc538dd61eebec506%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DAA-AfjblR72zy6EtY-LQ3hUu2Odz&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=1634907991288&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=22&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=2290&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C31084127%2C95354562%2C31091740%2C95357877%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3572312214205332&amp;tmod=1899943773&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-1%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=9&amp;uci=a!9&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=11856\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is quite difficult to make a wooden stick heavier, I try to make it heavier and shake it but it&rsquo;s quite difficult to hold. If it&rsquo;s this heavy the whole time, it will be difficult to swing, and if I try to make it heavy at the moment it hits, it will be difficult as well, perhaps I will end up just dropping it? For now, I will practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I try to wrap my wooden stick with packing magic. Is doing so a good idea if you do not understand the effect? I feel that something has changed, but I have no idea what happened. I&rsquo;m not sure if it makes sense to pack a wooden stick with magical power, but at the very least, it will serve as experience for my cane arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Movement] is difficult to understand because of [Walk]. It just feels like 10 steps worth of distance became 7 to 8 steps when I approached the goblins. The goblins seem just as surprised by my rapid approach as I was. Well, I killed them anyway though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to use [Movement] alone but when I use it together with [Walk], I faceplant into a wall. At this rate, I&rsquo;m going to gain a [Klutz] skill or title, and eventually, end up charging into goblins making stupid sounds. There is probably a demand for such a scene if it was a young girl but nobody would want to see the same with a high schoolboy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A random thought led me to try wrapping my body with [packing] magic. It took a bit of effort at first but I became faster at it until I was able to wrap my entire body within an instant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I try to move with my body wrapped in magic, then perhaps my body will move smoother and faster? The placebo effect? Sort of like that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there some sort of physical benefit? Or maybe that&rsquo;s because my defense and magic defense have gone up, regardless, I&rsquo;ll need practice to even understand the effect. Wrap my body with magic, move around, and hit things with a stick&hellip;it&rsquo;s a playground! Leave that sort of scene for little girls. There should be no demand for that type of scene with a highschool boy. How do I know this? Because I wouldn&rsquo;t want to see it either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s a trial and error, only after trying various things can I try to theorize carefully. I won&rsquo;t know anything until I try it out in live combat. I&rsquo;ll be able to tell if there&rsquo;s some sort of effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"9746952951\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!a\" data-google-query-id=\"CN3ClMqS2owDFTRPwgUde5UH5Q\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_9\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_9\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=9746952951&amp;adk=3510032111&amp;adf=2613040719&amp;pi=t.ma~as.9746952951&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744723781&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-2%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744723769231&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=250&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504140101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D01025ce41beeef37%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MZ2NCoeUPoOY_1yJ1hcKIcaTyADGA&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010a012dba8ca%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MYRL0kqEbb0pK7vrEL5ZMwwD40Z_w&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc538dd61eebec506%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DAA-AfjblR72zy6EtY-LQ3hUu2Odz&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=1634907991288&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=22&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=3168&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C31084127%2C95354562%2C31091740%2C95357877%2C95357716&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3572312214205332&amp;tmod=1899943773&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-1%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=10&amp;uci=a!a&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=11856\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being low on stamina is affecting me a lot but the magical exhaustion is even worse.

[Sensitive Body] leveled up! I haven&rsquo;t done anything weird? Seriously? I haven&rsquo;t met anything but goblins? There wasn&rsquo;t any dialogue between me and the goblins either.

Is this the leveling system where you level up as long as you kill your target?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I think about it, with my leveling debuffs, I didn&rsquo;t expect to level up by killing two goblins. My status was so pitiful that I could&rsquo;ve been killed by anything so leveling up after killing two goblins is also not too unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the two goblins were Lv 8 and Lv 7, it could have also been the additional experience from the level gap. I don&rsquo;t understand the parameters of the system. I want a deliveryman to bring me a book regarding knowledge of this world but I don&rsquo;t know the name of this world. I think that gramps told me but I don&rsquo;t remember. What a useless old man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been skipping out on doing gymnastics so today would be the first day I try it out but. It already leveled up? Is gymnastics the first skill that I master in another world? As the skill levels up, will I be able to learn the legendary, radio gymnastics #2? If I master this skill, will I be able to become the legendary radio man?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next is Appraisal, Presence detection, and Search. I&rsquo;ve been using this quite frequently and they&rsquo;ll be important skills in the future as well. I&rsquo;m glad that they leveled up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why I gained 「Wrapping Magic Lv 1」, and 「Magic Control Lv 1」. Is it perhaps because of practice? Or was it because I used Weight Magic in live combat?

My goal is to be able to wrap my entire body within an instant. Then I try running in different directions while trying a variety of movements.<br />\r\nI&rsquo;m definitely moving fast but I feel like rather than moving after thinking, I&rsquo;m thinking and moving into moving at the same time. My reaction speed has improved and I&rsquo;m no longer making unnecessary movements. I&rsquo;m gonna need time to get used to this. If I level up again by the time I get used to it then there&rsquo;s no point but you lose the moment you think like that. Am I going to start thinking that If I start working then I lose one of these days?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lightly, I can adjust the movement of my body while swinging the wooden stick. I attempt to trace my movements from the battle yesterday. I can only say that it feels great. From a bystanders perspective, it will appear as if my movements have gotten sharper? It&rsquo;s hard to ask a goblin, so I&rsquo;ll fight them to test it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a secret that I tried Movement and fell down.<br />\r\nFueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that they come out near the river, but when I loop back, I can see many signs of their presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be nice if I could find a small pack of them. I find two goblins but they&rsquo;re not far apart like yesterday so there&rsquo;s a high chance that it will turn into a 2v1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re levels are 9 and 11, slightly stronger than the ones from yesterday. I won&rsquo;t be fast enough to launch a sneak attack with just Walking. I run from the side to not kill any momentum. There was considerable resistance. Goblin A has become unable to move. I celebrated but the goblin didn&rsquo;t move, can you read the atmosphere?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"9746952951\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!6\" data-google-query-id=\"CJj9192S2owDFb1bDwIdc68zlg\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_5\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_5\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=9746952951&amp;adk=3510032111&amp;adf=2613040719&amp;pi=t.ma~as.9746952951&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744723822&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-3%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744723821154&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=196&amp;idt=547&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504140101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D01025ce41beeef37%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MZ2NCoeUPoOY_1yJ1hcKIcaTyADGA&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010a012dba8ca%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MYRL0kqEbb0pK7vrEL5ZMwwD40Z_w&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc538dd61eebec506%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DAA-AfjblR72zy6EtY-LQ3hUu2Odz&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=7263812600153&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=23&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=3264&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C95354562%2C31091740%2C95357877%2C95357716%2C95340253%2C95340255&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3607903802306666&amp;tmod=1899943773&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-2%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=0&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=6&amp;uci=a!6&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=884\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While avoiding the downward swing of Goblin B, I crouch down and move sideways. I circle to the back of the goblin and deliver a hit. Then I immediately fall back a set distance away and observe the situation. I don&rsquo;t let my guard down and pay attention to my surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Have I done it?]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite acting as if I had let my guard down, the goblins do not show any hint of movement, it appears they are dead. What a bunch of ignorant fools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It feels as if things went a lot smoother than yesterday. Not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve gotten used to fighting or if it&rsquo;s because of the level up. It&rsquo;s a pain to verify whether it&rsquo;s because of the effects of Wrapping Magic. It should be fine to leave it at the general conclusion that I&rsquo;ve become stronger. At least I&rsquo;ve now confirmed that I can fight goblins. I don&rsquo;t know of any other monsters but goblins nor any ingredients other than mushrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the effect of Wrapping Magic extend to the wooden stick? It feels as if it extends to the stick but I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly has changed, it does feel as if the stick has gotten stronger though.<br />\r\nI continue to look for more targets as I&rsquo;m not yet exhausted. My next targets are two goblins, Lv 7 and Lv 8. I eliminate them both in one hit. The goblins get weaker as I go upstream. They are weaker the closer they are to the riverside. Is the most dangerous part of the forest straight from the cave? The goblins also move around so I&rsquo;m not sure but there may be a gathering spot so I need to be careful. I will aim for a temporary truce with the goblins!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I head deep inside the forest from the cave side. There are two Lv 10 goblins and one Lv 13 goblin. As long as I kill the Lv 13 goblin in a surprise attack, the remaining two will be easy to deal with after. Lv 13 huh? As I had expected, they&rsquo;ve become stronger. Dealing with 3 at the same time seems a bit scary so I&rsquo;ll leave them here for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back to the cave, I deal with a Lv 11 and Lv 10 goblin in a flash. The Lv of the goblins are lower when heading down the river. If this is the case, I have my new hunting ground. If I try to fight goblins Lv 10 and above with brute force then I&rsquo;ll lose so I sneak attack them from behind, haste, evade and land a blow from the back. Using these 3 tactics are necessary. Any goblins above Lv 10 can only be defeated by building up momentum and sneak attacking them from behind. I will lose the fight without relying on a sneak attack until I master Movement. Why do I have to beat goblins to death with a stick as well&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a world of magic and swords, I&rsquo;m unemployed and hitting things with a stick. What are the future prospects of a person that ambushes goblins from behind with a stick? Ambushing with a stick makes me no different than a goblin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ins data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6973349055852983\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"6670692468\" data-ad-status=\"unfilled\" data-adsbygoogle-status=\"done\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><iframe allow=\"attribution-reporting; run-ad-auction\" allowtransparency=\"true\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" browsingtopics=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"a!7\" data-google-query-id=\"CILg592S2owDFXRfDwIdic8Bdg\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" id=\"aswift_6\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"aswift_6\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-6973349055852983&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=6670692468&amp;adk=1146076604&amp;adf=1608662326&amp;pi=t.ma~as.6670692468&amp;w=1030&amp;abgtt=6&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1744723822&amp;rafmt=1&amp;format=1030x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-3%2F&amp;fwr=0&amp;fwrattr=true&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTAuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSIsbnVsbCwwLG51bGwsIjY0IixbWyJHb29nbGUgQ2hyb21lIiwiMTM1LjAuNzA0OS44NSJdLFsiTm90LUEuQnJhbmQiLCI4LjAuMC4wIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjEzNS4wLjcwNDkuODUiXV0sMF0.&amp;dt=1744723821155&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=198&amp;idt=897&amp;shv=r20250410&amp;mjsv=m202504140101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D01025ce41beeef37%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MZ2NCoeUPoOY_1yJ1hcKIcaTyADGA&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010a012dba8ca%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DALNI_MYRL0kqEbb0pK7vrEL5ZMwwD40Z_w&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3Dc538dd61eebec506%3AT%3D1744723141%3ART%3D1744723564%3AS%3DAA-AfjblR72zy6EtY-LQ3hUu2Odz&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C1030x280%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C336x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=7263812600153&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=420&amp;u_his=23&amp;u_h=1080&amp;u_w=1920&amp;u_ah=1040&amp;u_aw=1920&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=255&amp;ady=3377&amp;biw=1905&amp;bih=953&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=95355973%2C95355975%2C95354562%2C31091740%2C95357877%2C95357716%2C95340253%2C95340255&amp;oid=2&amp;pvsid=3607903802306666&amp;tmod=1899943773&amp;uas=0&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Flightnovelstranslations.com%2Fnovel%2Fthe-loner-who-conquers-the-other-world-wn%2Fvolume-1-chapter-2-part-2%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1920%2C0%2C1920%2C1040%2C1920%2C953&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=128&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;td=1&amp;tdf=2&amp;psd=W251bGwsW251bGwsbnVsbCxudWxsLCJkZXByZWNhdGVkX2thbm9uIl0sbnVsbCwxXQ..&amp;nt=1&amp;pgls=CAEaBTYuNy4y~CAA.&amp;ifi=7&amp;uci=a!7&amp;btvi=5&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=1138\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Advertisement\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"1030\"></iframe></ins></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I arrive home slightly dazed. I weep slightly at my pitiful self. There is no need to deliberate on my dinner, it&rsquo;s mushrooms. Bon appetit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the time being, I put firewood and other resources in the corner of the cave. Even if I call them resources, they&rsquo;re easily breakable. Regardless it&rsquo;s a tree that defeated a demon. If I leave it alone, it&rsquo;ll eventually become firewood. If it can be processed, furniture and tools can be made. After that&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t used these clubs, and I&rsquo;ll probably never use them, but I&rsquo;ll leave a few of them in the item bag. I have no spare weapons yet and there&rsquo;s no harm in being too careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After bathing, I lie down in my tent. My back hurts if I lie down on the cave floor. I have a sleeping bag, but I want a bed that has double cushioning. Even a loner wants a comfy bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Lv didn&rsquo;t rise, I guess it&rsquo;s not so easy, after all, the rise of Lv is slow and bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t become strong overnight. I guess I just have to learn things one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider, train, test and practice skills, verify results, and improve skills. We have to make trials and errors endlessly and build our own way of fighting, we have no choice but to improve ourselves little by little. Since I&rsquo;ve transferred to another world, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a cheat, but a technique or weapon that&rsquo;s more cool is not too much to ask for is it? These skills are too plain. Another world&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t think, don&rsquo;t think, it&rsquo;s important to be steady, surely. So it seems that high school students before the examination were selected, and my class seems to be useless.<br />\r\n[2.

With the exception of being a bit stronger and his wounds healing slightly faster, Jin-Woo was about the same as regular people in every other aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was par for the course then, that hed always end up getting injured. He nearly died several times, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it wasnt as if Seong Jin-Woo liked being a Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work was dangerous, others made fun of him, and to confound the matters even further, the pay was pretty pathetic, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it werent for the medical aid paid out by the Hunter Association to the Hunters in their payroll, hed have turned in his hunter licence and quit by now, and live his life like a regular person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, someone like Seong Jin-Woo, in his mid-twenties and lacking in any tangible job skills, there was no other way but to remain as a Hunter if he wanted to pay for his mothers hospital fee of millions of won every month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should one say that he had no choice in the matter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was why, even though he didnt want to, he simply had to participate in the raid supervised by the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters operating within the same area tended to know each other pretty well. In the event of a Gate opening up, all the Hunters in that district would be asked to come, thats why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hunters who had arrived early sipped on the cups of coffee handed out by the Associations employee and shared cordial greetings with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, hey. Mister Kim, Over here. Here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh? Mister Park, what are you doing here? I thought you were giving up on being a Hunter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that My wife is pregnant with our second child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hahahaha, is that so. Yeah, for a Hunter to earn big in one go, participating in a raid is the best, isnt it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Kim jovially burst out in laughter. Mister Park followed suit with a sheepish chuckle, before asking Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, why do I feel like that the Association is calling on us less and less nowadays? Did the number of Gates decrease or something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eii, of course not. Thats only because the Guilds are getting all worked up over clearing the Gates; its got nothing to do with the Association. I hear that various Guilds are jumping in with both feet since there is big profit involved in this whole thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, in that case, since this raid is being supervised by the Association, it should be safe, no?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Park took a glance around as if he was getting nervous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a Guild was not involved today, that meant there wasnt enough profit to be had, and if there wasnt enough profit to be had, then that could only mean that this particular Gates difficulty would be low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, nothing in this world was 100% absolute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasnt just Mister Park; other Hunters were nervously glancing around as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm. I wonder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Kim finished the rest of his coffee while avoiding answering his friend, before spotting a certain someone and raised his hand in happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uh! Hes here. Hey, Mister Seong!! Mister Seong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Hunters also displayed joy at discovering that young man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, hello.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was none other than Seong Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo performed a simple nod of the head at the joyous Mister Kim and walked by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making sure Jin-Woo was well out of earshot, Mister Kim began sniggering while confidently speaking up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Jin-Woo showed up. Then its going to okay today, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Parks eyes widened up and he hurriedly asked Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was that? Is that Hunter Seong Jin-Woo really strong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahh. Right, of course, you wouldnt know who he is. Hes a Hunter who started working shortly after you left, you see. However, every Hunter here knows who that kid is by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hes really that strong? Wait, why is he working for the Association, then? Why not for a Guild or as a freelancer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim sniggered some more before narrowing his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know what that guys nickname is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How should I know that? Cmon, man. Just tell me already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humanitys weakest weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Weakest? Not something like, the ultimate weapon?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dude, thats the nickname for the rank S Hunter Choi Jong-In. That kid is the weakest weapon. Im pretty sure hes the weakest Hunter in the Republic of Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park began frowning deeply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would other Hunters greet this Seong Jin-Woo if he was really that weak? After all, didnt they need someone to trust their backs if things went south?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park couldnt really understand the reactions of other Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Parks head tilted this way and that, Kim chuckled and poked the side of Park with his elbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eii! The raids Seong Jin-Woo participates in will only have low difficulty because hes so weak. The Association would never entrust him with a tough job, dont you get that? They dont want to see him get killed, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only then did Parks expression brightened up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R-right. Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His wife was deeply worried about him since this would be his first raid in quite a while. Honestly, even he himself was worried, too. However, now that he listened to Kims words, he felt like a weight was lifted off his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim continued on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That guy, there was a rumour not too long ago that said, he got injured participating in a raid of a rank E Gate and spent a week in the hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Hunter got injured by a rank E Gate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thats right. No one expected to see a Hunter getting injured during a rank E Gate raid, so they didnt even bring along a Healer, apparently!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thats why he spent a week in a hospital?! Pu-hahaha!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Park began guffawing too loudly, Kim hurriedly hushed him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stop it, man. Mister Seong might hear you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aigoo. I didnt think of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park cautiously checked Jin-Woos reactions as he continued to giggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, the distance was far enough and the youth didnt seem to have heard them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, they were mistaken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can hear everything, you geezers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bitter smile formed on Jin-Woo as he tried hard to ignore them. At times like today, he couldnt help but blame his unusually-acute sense of hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed that he arrived too early and the raid was yet to commence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did I arrive too early?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo looked around to while away the waiting time, spotted the Association employee handing out warm coffee, and walked closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I get a cup of coffee as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh. Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim Im really sorry, but we ran out of coffee just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cold Winter breeze brushed past the tip of his nose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo quietly wiped his nose with his index finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a sad day it was, for the coffee to run out as soon as it was his turn to get one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do you persist on being a Hunter, Mister Seong Jin-Woo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo lowered his head and apologised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young, beautiful girl using healing magic in front of Jin-Woo, Yi Ju-Hui showed how unhappy she was with a pouting expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im not trying to get you to apologise, you know? Im only worried about you. If you continue fighting this way, sooner or later youll be faced with a truly dangerous situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo glanced past Yi Ju-Huis shoulders and took a look at other Hunters fighting over yonder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When one entered through the Gate, one would arrive at a place called dungeon. The rank of this particular dungeon should be around D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dozen-plus Hunters were taking care of the monsters inside this dungeon without so much as breaking a sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, for a rank E, such a feat was nearly impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the job of healing the injured Hunters from the back fell on the Healers. Since he always got injured during raids, Jin-Woo was rather well-known among the Healers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yi Ju-Hui cautiously asked him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perchance, is there a reason why you cant give up being a Hunter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo resolutely shook his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didnt want to reveal anything personal to other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im only doing this as a hobby. If I dont do this, Ill probably die of boredom, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yi Ju-Hui pouted even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you continue on with this hobby of yours, soon youd be raiding a dungeon in the netherworld, you know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo was taken off-guard from her remark and ended up chuckling out loudly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to that, Yi Ju-Huis nagging intensified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, ahh!! Dont laugh! Dont! Your injuries might get worse!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo giggled before asking her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did you even learn to say stuff like that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you mean, where? Its from Mister Kim waaay over there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aigoo, that ahjussi really went and did it, didnt he.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they chatted and laughed, his treatment was almost over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was already too late by then, though. It seemed that the raid was pretty much over now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos expression hardened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I only killed a single monster today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rank E creature, no less. Seong Jin-Woo began fidgeting with the rank E magic crystal in his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lowest grade magic crystal from a rank E monster fetched less than hundred thousand won. For something he bet his life to earn, it was a pathetically small amount. (TL: Just over $88.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A magic crystal from a rank C monster can sell for over ten million won, though. (TL: $8830+)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too bad, a rank E Hunter such as himself couldnt even attempt to kill a monster with a rank as high as C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the blue, someone shouted out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uh? Hey, theres another entrance over here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nearby Hunters rushed over there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh, its true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There really is another path?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as that Hunter said, there was an entrance hidden within the dungeon itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dual dungeon, is it So, such a thing actually exists for real.Chck out ltst vl on n/o/v/l/bin(.)c//m</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Song, possessing over ten years experience as a Hunter, looked into the hidden entrance and displayed how surprised he was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the hidden, cave-like passage was dark and nothing could be seen. Mister Song activated his speciality, flame magic, and tossed it further forward into the passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flame flew forward and illuminated the interior. The passageway seemed to go on forever. Soon enough, the flame lost its forward momentum, fell to the ground and smouldered for a bit before flickering out of existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passage was shrouded in darkness once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm.. Everyone, gather around. Lets have a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unspoken leader of this raid, Mister Song, called for other Hunters to gather around. Jin-Woos treatment was over by then, so he and Yi Ju-Hui also joined in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song spoke up while sweeping his gaze over the gathered Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know very well, a Gate will not close unless the dungeons boss is killed. Since the Gate itself is still intact even though we took care of all the monsters here, that can only mean that the boss is beyond that passageway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song pointed towards the hidden entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters exchanged meaningful glances and nodded their heads. No one could disagree with that notion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song continued on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now normally, were supposed to relay this information back to the Association and wait for their decision first, but But, if we do that, we might end up handing over the task of killing the boss to other Hunters, and our takings for todays raid would decrease by a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expressions of the Hunters crumpled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parks face hardened more than anyone else since he needed a lot of cash for his wifes pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postnatal care eats up so much cash nowadays, you know</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this rate, thered be no meaning behind him risking his life to participate in this raid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thats why Id prefer if we took care of the boss before leaving this dungeon So, what do you all think?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters fell into a deep contemplation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth was, no one here could figure out the current situation and so, their safety could not be guaranteed. However, the difficulty of this particular dungeon proved to be very low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the hidden dungeon within it couldnt have been that difficult, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm, hmm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song coughed to draw everyones attention to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we have seventeen people here, lets put this to a vote, shall we? Once the decision has been made, no one complains. So? How about it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others nodded their heads after hearing Songs suggestion. No one was disagreeing with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I vote for going ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song raised his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, other Hunters began raising their hands one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Count me in as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park was the first to raise his hand, followed shortly after by Kim and a few other Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, those disagreeing were plentiful, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets go back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel that itd be better to wait for the Associations decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two opposing camps were neck and neck and eventually, the final votes came down to Jin-Woo and Yi Ju-Hui.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yi Ju-Hui bowed to Song and added her vote to retreat camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, the vote count for go ahead and retreat was at 8:8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A deadlock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song asked the hesitant Seong Jin-Woo next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you, Mister Seong?</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 17:35:28', '2025-04-15 17:35:28'),
(25, 15, 'Chapter 2', 'chapter-2', '<p>Everything now depended on Seong Jin-Woos decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos fingers grasped tight the rank E magic crystal in his hand as he took a glance next to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yi Ju-Hui was shaking her head at him. It looked like she was deeply worried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, Jin-Woo was worried inwardly as well. Now normally, he would never try to take on any unnecessary risk. Not only did he lack the abilities to do so, but he was also not brave enough, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Jin-Woo had a younger sister who was about to become a university student in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ive no money saved up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Jin-Woo was twenty-four years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was at an age where he should be concentrating on his academic pursuits, but he gave up on that dream because, well, he had no money. He sure as hell didnt want his little sister to go through the same sacrifice, the same pain as he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, every cent was precious to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasnt only Mister Park who needed a big score today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo raised his hand up high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I vote for going ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then, he heard a soft sigh of resignation coming from his side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2: The Dual Dungeon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passageway went on and on forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In front, Mister Song and other strong Hunters had taken the lead. Song had summoned a small flame on top of his palm to illuminate the way forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Kim asked him as he walked alongside Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weve walked really far, havent we? Shouldnt we consider the time we need to escape from here as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long have we been walking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim looked at his wristwatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around. forty minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Gate shuts down completely one hour after the boss is killed, so we have a window of twenty minutes left or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we cant see the boss in the next twenty minutes, I suggest that we should just give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song nodded his head for a while, before pointing to his back with his thumb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Kim? Its dark out in front, so why dont you position yourself behind me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim stared at Songs flames for a second or two, before he wordlessly pulled out his smartphone and switched on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, the passageway got illuminated rather brightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song alternated his gaze between his flame and the smartphone, before he too wordlessly began searching for his own phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very back of the group was the spot reserved for Seong Jin-Woo, who was injured pretty badly not too long ago, and Yi Ju-Hui, who didnt possess any combat skills whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo scratched the back of his neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pardon me, I Im really sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About, you know, dragging you here against your wishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im fine with it, so you dont need to mind me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo cautiously studied Ju-Huis expression. She definitely did not look fine at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo tilted his head this way and that while trying to read her mood better, before he asked her again, even more cautious than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you really fine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That prompted Ju-Hui to shift her gaze towards him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course Im not. Are you of a sane mind?! If you were stabbed a couple of inches higher, youd have a hole in your heart by now! And, what about those injuries on your arms and legs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked so hard to heal you somehow, yet you wish to throw yourself into yet another dungeon?? Plus, you dont even know where were going, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She spoke so quickly that Jin-Woo felt like his mind was getting numb from hearing her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, she was right about everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it werent for the presence of the outstanding Healer ranked B, Yi Ju-Hui, Jin-Woo wouldnt have been able to carry on living unaffected, never mind working as a Hunter. It was a small wonder why such high ranked and hard-to-find Healers were valued so greatly within the halls of the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, now that I think about it, I owe Miss Ju-Hui a lot, dont I?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui was a Healer-type Hunter, a rarest of the rare breeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, she was a genius ranked at B as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Association always asked her to heal the injured Hunters whenever a Gate opened up. And whenever Jin-Woo participated in a raid, hed almost always end up sitting down next to her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you in pain? Please hold on for a little while longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Havent I seen you before.? By any chance, are you the person from the last time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youre injured again?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its like, were running into each other quite often nowadays, isnt it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You said that your name is Mister Jin-Woo? Well, that Is it going to be alright?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, uhm, this life of a Hunter doesnt really suit you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Youre here again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show me your arm. No, not that one. Use bandages on that arm. I meant the other one with the bone fracture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, it was way past the point of Jin-Woo feeling grateful for everything she had done, and firmly into the territory of him being apologetic for inconveniencing her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jin-Woo looked dispirited, Ju-Hui also felt a bit bad about scolding him just now and her attitude softened up considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youre really sorry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui fell into a deep contemplation for a bit, before she began gazing at him with the corner of her eyes and her lips slowly arched up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If youre really sorry, then how about you buy me dinner sometime?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that was a totally unexpected offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo looked at her with an expression of surprise and found a teasing smile etched on her face like a teenage girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A teen girl, huh..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth was, Ju-Hui was still a young girl who had barely entered her twenties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Didnt she say that shed be twenty-one next year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If her long hair was replaced with something shorter, and her current attire was swapped out for a school uniform, shed completely look like high school senior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His wandering mind pictured the image of Ju-Hui in a school uniform and his face reddened up somewhat.V/\\\\IssT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n)./ for the b/est novel reading experi/en/ce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jin-Woo hesitated with his answer, Ju-Huis cheeks began puffing up like a balloon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the You dont want to buy me dinner?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It happened, right then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, it became quite hectic out in front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found it!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its the boss chamber!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo and Ju-Huis gazes automatically shifted to the front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they saw a huge stone door blocking the passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters immediately surrounded this door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is this? Why is there a door at the end of the cavern?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have we ever encountered a boss chamber with a door before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is definitely the first time, Im sure of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Doesnt this feel strangely dangerous?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters began to express their doubts and fears one at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since their own lives were on the line here, they had to be cautious and meticulous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if one were to become too cautious, one would end up failing to grasp the heaven-sent opportunity in the first place. Mister Song figured this was one such case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you all planning to return empty-handed after coming this far?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song placed his hands on the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If thats what you want, knock yourselves out. Im pushing ahead, even if it means Ill be going alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song was a rank C Hunter with ten years of experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it werent for his age, which was over sixty, hed be making a killing in a big Guild by now thanks to his excellent skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when a Hunter like that voiced his opinion with such confidence, others began to feel less anxious than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait a minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of Hunters began recalling rumours of dual dungeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard that there are incredible treasures hidden within dual dungeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, I heard that a certain small to medium Guild found a dual dungeon and grew into a large Guild almost overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monsters inside a dungeon always possess roughly the similar ranks no matter where they are located, so the hunt itself should not be too difficult</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if there were incredible treasures hidden with the dual dungeon just as the rumours said, and the monsters beyond this door were about the same difficulty as the rank D, E creatures they fought until now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cant let that old man monopolise all the treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No freaking way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postnatal care, the school fee for the first born kid, and lets not forget, this months rent is almost due, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opinions of the Hunters were now on the same page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo, too, steeled himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cant return home with just a single rank E magic crystal. At a bare minimum, I gotta kill a rank D, no, one more rank E monster!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It didnt even have to be a monster, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If its treasure instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasures or rare loot found in a dungeon would normally be divided equally among all the participants in a raid. It was quite a different way of sharing the rewards where one could only take possession of magic crystals one procured by themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we score big today, then things might improve at home for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo nervously swallowed down his saliva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui saw his determined expression and asked him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that how the expression of someone whos a Hunter as a hobby looks like?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo shrugged his shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whod bet their lives in their main line of profession nowadays? Unless its a hobby, obviously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>..Eh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as a dumbfounded expression formed on Ju-Huis face, Song pushed the dungeons door and it creaked open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There mustve been some sort of mechanism installed on the heavy-looking door, since the physical strength of a sixty-year-old man was enough to easily open it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slam!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the door was wide open, the huge open interior revealed itself. Hunters hurriedly rushed in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets go in as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo feared that hed fall behind, so he grasped Ju-Huis hand and took the lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Huis face reddened slightly as she followed after him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as Hunters sat foot inside, flames erupted on the numerous torches packed tightly on the walls all at the same time. Thanks to that, the interior brightened up considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whats the heck? The lights came on by themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First time seeing a dungeon like this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somethings. different about this place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters cautiously studied their surroundings. The overall atmosphere of the place was similar to that of an ancient temple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, an old and somewhat decrepit temple, something that might be buried and hidden beneath the ground; moss and weed could be seen sporadically on the floor, walls and the ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several Hunters shrunk back and shuddered slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>its a bit creepy in here, isnt it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doesnt it feel like were being watched by someone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving behind the scared Hunters, the three, four strongest of the group went in deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tsk! Dont say something that might jinx us, will ya?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets end this quickly and go home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior was nonsensically huge. The chamber was shaped like a giant dome. It was as large as several Olympic stadiums, the one found in Seoul, were put together no, maybe it was even bigger than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one couldnt help but feel that it was still inadequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for that was rather obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That. that thing over there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N-no freaking way that things the boss, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the deepest part of the dome, something so logic-defyingly humongous sat on a throne just as big as itself. It was none other than a huge stone statue of a god!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, my god.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shocked gasps leaked out from the Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first image popping up in Jin-Woos head was of the Statue of Liberty in New York. If that statue sat down on a chair, wouldnt it be as big as that statue of the unknown god?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, Liberty was a woman, while the one sitting on the throne was a dude, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, hang on. Maybe its even bigger than that</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters began nervously swallowing their saliva near the foot of the god statue. The taut and heavy apprehension and anxiety were clear to see on their faces as they worried about this statue being the dungeons boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the statue did not budge an inch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a fortunate thing that was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Song spat out a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, everyone. Spread out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that they found some leeway, Hunters split among themselves and began searching around the vicinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dont think theres a single monster in here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You think so, too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never mind a monster, I cant even see a single bug, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chamber of the stone god statue might have been massive, yet its actual inner structure was on the simpler side. On the walls, countless torches could be found there. And in front of these walls, more stone statues, slightly taller than a human being, stood tall and unmoving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were lots of them here as well, found at a certain distance from one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are all rather beautiful, arent they?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its like, they are works of art, no?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objects held by each of the stone statues were varied and different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some held weapons, there was one with a book, some carried musical instruments, and even torches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its as if.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are like statues of a holy temple or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song finished what Kim wanted to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mm?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Song found something beneath his feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Isnt this a magic formation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He found a magic formation that he had never seen before located in the middle of this temple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excuse me, Mister Song? Ahjussi, somethings written here. Can you come over here and take a look?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Hunters discovered a statue that was different from others and called out to Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song stopped studying the magic formation and got up from the floor. Other Hunters all gathered around the statue Song was headed off to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only this statue featured a pair of wings and carried a stone slate. What the Hunters focused on was the letters carved into this slate. Song took a sweeping look at the slate and muttered to no one in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Rune alphabet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rune alphabet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Words that could not be found anywhere on Earth, and found only within dungeons; only the Hunters who had awakened the magic-related professions could decipher them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The laws of the Karutenon temple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song read the very first verse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a deeply nervous face, Jin-Woo listened to the contents of the slate, as read out by Mister Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, someone suddenly tugged at his arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he looked back, he spotted Ju-Hui and her deathly-pale complexion.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 17:36:17', '2025-04-15 17:36:17'),

Are you ill somewhere?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>T-there. Over there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos eyes followed Ju-Huis trembling pointing finger. She was pointing at the giant god statue. More specifically, she was pointing at the god statues face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo could only tilt his head in confusion because it looked pretty much the same as before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui stuttered some words out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The, the eyes The eyes of the god statue moved towards us.

There was no visible change to the god statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eii Im sure youve made a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it seemed like Ju-Hui didnt hear him; her head stayed lowered, and as she held onto Jin-Woos arm, her entire body trembled even harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hang on a sec here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Jin-Woo picked up on this strange but ominous sensation now. The world was eerily quiet. So much so, it felt just too bizarre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No sounds.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the sounds of the flames burning on the torches could not be heard anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, Songs voice continued on as he read the contents of the slate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worship the god. Second law. Exalt the god. Third law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prove your piety. Those who do not keep to these laws shall not leave this place alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SLAM!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone was jolted back to their senses at the sudden explosion of noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, what was that?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did that sudden noise come from?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first person to notice the change in the situation was none other than Jin-Woo. Because his senses were running at full tilt already, he could tell where the noise was coming from right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door!! The door is closed!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as Jin-Woo shouted out, everyone shifted their gazes towards the doorway. The door they left open was now firmly shut close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God d*mn it! I cant stand this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hunter who was the first to oppose the idea of continued exploration of the dungeon began spitting out cusses as he took large strides towards the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im going home, so you all can have fun with a boss or treasures or whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Hunter glared at Song with an expression that contained all of his dissatisfaction before he spun his head around and angrily grabbed the door handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It happened, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Songs eyes grew extra large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Splash!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area above the Hunters neck suddenly vanished. The headless body powerlessly collapsed to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K, kkkkyaaachk?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uwaa?! Uwaak!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters began screaming their heads off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stone statue that smashed a humans head apart with a steel mace returned to its original spot next to the door, as if nothing important had happened, its body completely covered in fresh blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, that thing can move?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the hell?? Does that mean every statue in here can move, too?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We gotta fight against these things?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldnt even see that d*mn thing swing the mace, so how can I?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike others here, though, Jin-Woo knew the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Their troubles only had just begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Didnt Ju-Hui say it earlier?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If what she said is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chill rapidly ran down his spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo forced his stiff neck to turn around so he could look behind him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Oh, sh*t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stone statue of the god was looking down at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 3: Commencement of the attack</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then, the god statues two black eyes changed to red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was this the instincts of a Hunter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, the instincts of a living being were sending out urgent warning signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something was coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something none of them could contend with!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo turned towards the other Hunters and cried out as loudly as he could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get down!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost at the same time, red beams of light shot out from the eyes of the god statue. Jin-Woo hugged Ju-Hui and threw their bodies to the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUZZZ!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beam shot right by the spot Jin-Woo had been standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tenth of a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, he survived by one-hundredth of a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was definitely too close for comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, not everyone was as lucky as Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uwaaahk?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euh-ahahack!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who were swallowed up by the red light evaporated where they stood. Only the ashes of what used to be human Hunters remained where the beam flew past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The screams came not from the dead Hunters, but those who witnessed their final moments from the sidelines, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the f*ck was that?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euh, euh-euh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How, how can such a thing even be</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining Hunters began freaking out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the seventeen Hunters, only eleven survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not one of them had ever experienced such a powerful attack before in their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I barely made it because he told me to get down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it wasnt for Mister Seongs shouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters stared at Jin-Woo while nervously swallowing their saliva. Jin-Woo turned out to be their unlikely saviour. Without his timely warning, they could only imagine what wouldve happened to them and that thought sent chills down their spines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While still lying prostrate on the ground, Jin-Woo glared at the god statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its eyes were still glowing in red, but it did not attack again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the attack over?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo looked underneath him. The scared-silly Yi Ju-Hui was trembling in his arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the reason why she worked for the Association and not for a big Guild, and participated in simple raids like this one, even though she was nominally an excellent Hunter with a rank as high as B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Huis breathing was getting rougher by the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He couldnt let her be like this. He had to do something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo was about to raise his body up, thinking that he gotta do something here, but then, someone grabbed his shoulders and pushed him back down, hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dont get up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Mister Song, somehow next to the youth before anyone had noticed it. Jin-Woo was flustered, but still did as he was told.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song then shouted at the other Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody move! Stay exactly where you are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song looked around before focusing on Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only those that moved got killed. Those who listened to you and got down survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song tilted his head slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought you warned us because you figured something out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, well, I just felt something dangerous was coming, so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A flash of light brushed past Songs eyes just then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His instincts are pretty good, in other words. Hes a rank E Hunter? If only his abilities were a bit higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Song stared at Jin-Woo with a rueful expression, Jin-Woo too found a little bit of leeway to check out the older Hunters condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the youths eyes opened up wider after finding something pretty terrible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A-ahjussi, your, your Your arm?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is nothing. I can still hold on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, but, still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo swallowed down his saliva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Songs other hand that wasnt pressing down on Jin-Woos shoulder, his left arm, was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song studied Ju-Huis conditions for a bit, before he took off the T-shirt he was wearing, and while not even showing the enormous amount of pain he must be feeling, he wrapped up what was left of his left arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Help me tie up the end, please? Its difficult to so with only one hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo could only nod his head then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were able to somehow stop the bleeding for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than a scream or a pained moan, Song let out a long sigh. It was a sigh containing ten years worth of experience as a Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuu..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the first-aid was over, Songs gaze became a level sharper as he studied his surroundings. Although the god statue stopped attacking them, their situation hadnt improved in the slightest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And like so, seconds continued to tick by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sob, sob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just why do we have to suffer like this, this..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few Hunters even began shedding tears now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cant stay like this forever!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patience of the other Hunters was running out as well. Jin-Woo agreed with that sentiment, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right, we cant stay here forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, what could he possibly do here? If Songs suspicion was correct, then the moment they moved, theyd get attacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, even if they got lucky and managed to evade the beams and reach the door, there were the two stone statues guarding the doorway to worry about, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were a big problem too, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movements of the doorkeepers were so fast that he couldnt see it with his eyes. Could he or anyone else open the door and escape before those statues attacked them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It sounded completely impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which meant that the annihilation of the Hunters was just a matter of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait.. A matter of time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When his thoughts arrived there, a strong sense of disharmony filled him up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An event that couldnt have happened, but it happened anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no one else seemed to have picked up on it yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something We missed something here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a doubt, the answer to their salvation hid in that something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dont move!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song shouted at Mister Joo, who was at the far end of the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shut up! Who knows when that thing will start attacking us again!! But you want me to stay here and wait?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Joo was a close-combat type Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of Hunters possessed far, far superior physical abilities than regular human beings. On top of this, Joo was about to sign up with a big Guild after his skills were acknowledged by them not too long ago as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ill not die here today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While keeping low to the ground, Joo put all his strength down to his legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His aim was at the doorway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The muscles on his legs were swelling up fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D*mn it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song could only mutter out to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right then, Joo kicked the ground and exploded forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Jin-Woo hurriedly turned his head to look at the god statue. Just as he suspected, the eyes of the statue were fixed on the back of mister Joo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, the chilling red ray shot out from those eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUZZ!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beam slammed on the back of Mister Joo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kkyaaahck!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The female Hunter screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She mustve developed a leak, because a puddle of yellow liquid formed where she was squatting on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expressions of the Hunters froze, hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh my god.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Joo no longer stood where the red beam flew past. Only the pair of ownerless ankles could be seen now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the men with a weaker constitution began emptying the contents of his stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B-blergh!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos expression also crumpled as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, the god statue could easily finish them off if it felt like it. Itd be easier than stepping on squirming bugs, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If thats the case, then. Why hadnt it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could kill them, yet it hadnt done that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a completely different pattern of behaviour compared to the monsters that attacked as soon as spotting human Hunters in their vicinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These statues only moved if certain conditions were met: the doorkeepers that only attacked if someone approached the door; the eyes of the god statue firing that red beam if someone moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was like a game with a set regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hang on Could there be some kind of rules in this chamber?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was here that a piece of puzzle found its place in Jin-Woos head. He began recalling the contents of the stone slate Song was reading not too long ago, that was why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The laws of the Karutenon temple, was it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulation was rules, and rules could be laws as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to their safe escape from this camber had to be buried within those warnings found on the stone slate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Worship the god.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the first law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mm? Did you just say something?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song shifted his gaze back to Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of a reply, Jin-Woo simply placed his index finger on his lips. It was a sign asking for a bit of time to think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If my thoughts are right</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo slowly rose up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song hurriedly tried to stop the youth, but Jin-Woo shook his head while carrying a determined expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Doesnt look like he gave up on living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song nodded his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo kept his eyes trained squarely at the god statue and carefully stood up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost right away, the eyes of the statue were fixed on Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as expected, the red beam was fired in his direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he got down to the ground a moment slower, itd be his face melting away, instead of a few strands of hair on top of his head!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lying face down on the ground, Jin-Woo breathed in and out quite heavily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heok, heok, heok, heok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He nearly died just then. The moment the statues eyes met his, he thought he was going to die for sure. He somehow did dodge it, but his legs wouldnt stop shaking from the fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he learned something important just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its not attacking someone whos moving around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as he was squatting low to the ground, he could go anywhere he wanted to and the statues eyes would remain still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if one stood up, then the red beam would be fired without hesitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The d*mn thing only attacks if we breach a certain height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was why Jin-Woo bet his life on proving this theory right just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now, he was sure of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meaning behind the first law, that was!</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 17:37:55', '2025-04-15 17:37:55');

What bullsh*t are you spewing here?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the hell! How can you say something like that under the current circumstances?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you lost your mind, Seong Jin-Woo?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kims face became boiling-red as he began snorting like a bull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea you, Mister Seong, would be like this! If I could move, then Id have punched you in the face already!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo bit on his lower lip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six of their comrades were killed by the god statue. So, it was rather obvious that the surviving Hunters would cuss him out when he told them to kowtow towards that abominable thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasnt hard to understand what these Hunters were feeling at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, the most important thing is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing was, he had no logical evidence to back his theory up. He only had his gut feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, that was the only way to describe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ill do as you say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That voice came from Jin-Woos back. Everyones eyes immediately shifted there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Mister Song, effectively the leader of this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Song ahjussi?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are going to kowtow to that f*cking statue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as other Hunters began to freak out, Song looked straight at Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young man. Youve discovered something, havent you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo resolutely nodded his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it your instinct again?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>..Yes. For the time being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just now, eleven people survived thanks to Jin-Woos instincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, with the death of Mister Joo, there were ten now, but still if it was Jin-Woos instincts, then wouldnt it be worth believing it at least once more?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thats what Song thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Song knelt down and kowtowed towards the god statue, the mood had become solemn and silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Hes really doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seizing upon this opportunity, Jin-Woo shouted out once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone, I beg of you! Please kneel before the god statue. We might be able to get out of here alive!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Might live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Might be able to get out alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact those simple words carried was quite explosive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We might live?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can get out of here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With just one kowtow?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hesitant Hunters began to plop down to the ground, as if they were really kowtowing. The number of them performing the act gradually increased. In the end, even the complaining Kim bowed his head towards the statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there was no visible change to the god statue. Indeed, those chilling red light still shone from the eyes of the statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo felt his heart go cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was I wrong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was here that his gaze shifted to Ju-Hui next to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how generous one was, it was difficult to describe her posture of squatting on the ground shivering, while holding her head in her hands as her kowtowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo carefully grasped Ju-Huis wrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She raised her head like a scared cat. Seeing her, Jin-Woo wordlessly nodded his head. Only then did she relax her muscles somewhat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, Jin-Woo was able to slowly change her posture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was only one person remaining now. And that would be him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo knelt down towards the god statue, placed his hands on the ground, and slowly lowered his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, something began to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh? Uh, uhh?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters who had noticed the change first raised their voices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The god statue!! Look at the statue!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its eyes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red light buzzing in its eyes was gradually weakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the hell? Is this really going to work??</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the red light completely vanished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh!! Ohhh!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters began rejoicing loudly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red light is gone!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We made it!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The excited Hunters began standing up one at the time. Even then, the statue didnt fire the red beam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo belatedly raised his head and spat out a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he suspected this chamber operated strictly within the set regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If thats the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, this game was far from over. Two more laws still remained. The second law, exalt the god. And the third law, prove ones piety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUMBLE!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accompanied by a goosebump-inducing noise, the entire chamber began to shake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos expression hardened immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His suspicions proved to be correct once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things were only getting started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The humongous god statue was slowly rising up from the stone throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh?! Huhhh???</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters were hugging each other while shedding tears of joy until then, but when they realised this turn of events, they all froze up like statues themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What. what the hell!! It wasnt over yet?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, this cant be!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of them could articulate what they wanted to say. Despair rapidly dyed their expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah..Ah, ah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, the god statue completely stood up from the throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creature swept its gaze around once, and began walking towards the Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time the god statue stepped on the ground, the whole world seemed to shake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was so tall that its head was almost scraping against the chambers indescribably high ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when the Hunters were overwhelmed by the statues sheer size, the thing was gradually closing its distance to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Seong!! Mister Seong Jin-Woo!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can we do??</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hunters who were cussing at Jin-Woo only a short while ago hurriedly began crowding around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there a way out of this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say something!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these adults were forming tearful expressions as if theyd start breaking down in sobs and wails very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Jin-Woo was their only hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo helped the frozen-stiff Ju-Hui up from the ground and began talking about the second law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exalt the god. Thats the key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, isnt that?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim suddenly butted in as if he knew something others didnt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isnt that whats written on the slate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correct. Worship the god. Exalt the god. And finally, prove your piety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to satisfy all three laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo began speaking faster and faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? The god statue was already a stones throw away from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyones complexion paled as the gigantic shadow loomed over them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let, let me try something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A young male Hunter who usually kept to himself suddenly took a step forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the?! What are you trying to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ive been in a church choir. Im confident if its about exalting something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young Hunter slowly stepped forward towards the statue while disregarding the dissuasion of Kim. He regulated his breathing while looking up at the god statue before he took a large gulp of air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I come to you, Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His clear voice began reverberating within the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Renew my faith once more.. Bless me with your grace, Lord</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statue stopped its march in front of the singing Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters began gasping out in elation. The god statue didnt move from the spot as if it was absorbed by the singing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the other noises in the room vanished. Only the young mans voice could be heard in the chambers interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young Hunter was encouraged by this and carried on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the weakness found in me Through your love, I shall overcome</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Hunters, only Jin-Woo was shuddering from this ominous sensation filling him up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This this is wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo swallowed up his words several times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chamber featured its own set of rules. But the young Hunter was exalting the god statue with the rule of Christianity, not with the rules of this chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, the statue wasnt moving but, could singing that hymn qualify as upholding the rules?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo shook his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only reason why he didnt say anything was solely because he couldnt think of a better way to stop the god statue himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was right then!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weighty noise reverberated throughout the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K, kkkkyyyyaaahhhk!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The female Hunter screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the stone statue lifted its leg up, bloody mess of what used to be the young Hunter could be found on the ground as well as on the bottom of its foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Hunters began screaming in panic and shock, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahhhhh?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uwa, uwaaaahk!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The face of the statue, emotionless until then, was now crumpled in pure rage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its angry!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Run, run away!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters dispersed away from the statue in a hurry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for the female Hunter, she lost her reasoning and stood on the spot while screaming loudly after personally witnessing the death of the young male Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K, kyaaachk!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D*mn it..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo was running away while carrying Ju-Hui in his arms, but he turned around so he could go and help that woman out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then, Song stopped the youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, ahjussi?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if slapping a fly down, the god statue slammed its palm down at the female Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SLAM!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keuk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo inadvertently shifted his gaze away. It was a truly gruesome sight and he couldnt bear to watch it unfold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no time to waste like this. Are you planning to let this girl die, too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Songs words sobered Jin-Woo up in an instant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was as he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uwaahk!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Help me!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statue was not walking around anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, it was actually running around and stepping on the humans it found nearby. Whenever the thing stepped on the ground, the entire chamber shook around, hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!! THUD!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo gritted his teeth and began running again. Ju-Hui squeezed her eyes shut and held onto him for her dear life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets split up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking that moving around together was dangerous, Jin-Woo and Song ran in separate directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo made sure to run towards the furthest corner from the frenzied god statue. However, there was another Hunter who had arrived there before he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Mister Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park was running with everything he had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tears formed on the edges of his eyes when he recalled his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sob</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back home, a son who resembled him so much and a wife pregnant with their second child was waiting for him. He couldnt die here, not like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps because he ran with everything he had, he was able to run the furthest away from the statue out of everyone here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, pant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Park tried to control his heavy breathing in the corner, his friend Kim urgently shouted at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Park!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park raised his head after hearing the familiar voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim pointed at the spot behind Park and cried out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your back!! Look behind you!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then, something sharp gleamed coldly behind Mister Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slice!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park was sliced in half from the top of his head right down to his groin. His cleanly-cut two halves fell to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PARK!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stone statue that killed Park with its greatsword returned to its position as if nothing had happened, exactly like how the doorkeeper did before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim began tearing up after witnessing this scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You sons of b*tches.!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind him, the humongous god statue was stepping on and killing humans one at the time, and if you ran towards the corner in order to avoid it, then the stone statues located there would start attacking you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U, uwaaaah!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My arm!! My armmmm!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the chamber swiftly fell into chaos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heok, heok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cold sweat dripped down from Jin-Woos forehead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His legs were getting heavier. His breathing was getting rougher and rougher. However, his head was filled with only one chain of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exalt the god. Exalt the god. Exalt the god.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The words of the second law circulated in his brain non-stop. The key to unravelling this mystery definitely existed within this chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something within this chamber that they could use!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when the Hunters first entered this place, they had searched every nook and cranny, but didnt find a single contraption nor things that might be some kind of tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, back then or now, the only things here that can move are the stone statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A thought raced past Jin-Woos brain just then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only things moving in here are the statues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D*mn it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos eyes widened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why havent I thought of that before?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the only things that could move were the stone statues, then the only thing he could use had to be them, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These statues activated when humans got near them, meaning he had to take advantage of this rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if.!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though he was running short of breath, Jin-Woo roared out loud enough to shake the entire chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Run towards the statues holding musical instruments!!</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 17:38:56', '2025-04-15 17:38:56'),
(28, 15, 'Chapter 5', 'chapter-5', '<p>All the Hunters still alive heard Jin-Woos voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instruments?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A ray of hope found its way into the eyes of the Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite different to back when he told them to kowtow, everyone moved unbelievably quickly. If Jin-Woo was wrong about this, then as soon as arriving near one, they would be killed by the stone statues holding the musical instruments. However, no one here questioned Jin-Woos words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song was the first one to arrive in front of a statue carrying a musical instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song controlled his heavy breathing and raised his head to look at the statue. And as if it was a lie, the fingers of the statue moved and strummed on the harp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cling, clang</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A beautiful melody flowed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its working!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurry to the statues with instruments!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters ran towards the nearest correct statues in hurried footsteps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statue with a trumpet began blowing it triumphantly; one with a flute began playing with it; the one holding the lyre strummed on its strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heok, heok, heok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While sensing the approach of his physical limit, Kim somehow arrived in front of the statue that held a buzuka and plopped down to the ground. (TL: I dont know what this buzuka could be. TLed as is from the raw.) (ED: Probably either a Bazooka or a Bouzouki, both from the 1900s.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ttiring, ttring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as the statue began playing the instrument, the god statue stopped chasing after Kim. He mustve been overcome with emotions, because Kim then began shedding tears while he stayed down on his knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sob. Sob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the god statue turned around. The creature searched around and soon enough, found its next prey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God d*mn it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo spat out a cuss as his gaze met the god statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then began running hard so hard that his heart might explode. His back was already soaked through in sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why?! Why isnt it working?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos resentful glare landed on the stone statue in front of him. The statue holding a drum showed no signs of moving at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!! THUD!! THUD!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The god statue closed in with frightening speed. He was practically on the other side of the chamber from the d*mn thing, yet the distance between the two shortened in no time at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo swallowed down his saliva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be that the statue wont play because there are two people here? Me and Miss Ju-Hui?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He couldnt think of anything else. Why? Because, other statues were playing music just fine as soon a Hunter stood in front of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no time to think anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo put Ju-Hui down and got ready to run to somewhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M, Mister Jin-Woo..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still terrified out of her mind, Ju-Hui clung onto Jin-Woos sleeve. Jin-Woo calmly whispered in her ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well both die if we stay together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tears began forming on Ju-Huis eyes. Her fingers trembled as they held onto his clothes. Unfortunately, there was no time to explain to her in detail. Jin-Woo carefully pried her hand away and began running in the opposite direction as hard as he could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boom, boom, boom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he glanced back, the statue behind Ju-Hui began beating its drum in a slow but steady rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was only one thing remaining now: to run to the other statue without getting killed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only Jin-Woo hadnt received the protection of the music-playing statues. Quite obviously, the rage of the god statue was solely directed to Jin-Woo and him alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo did his best to avoid the foot of the thing that rivalled a building in size and crossed the room in a hurry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THUD!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He fell and rolled around but still, he somehow managed to avoid getting flattened by the god statues foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heok, heok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He might only have been a rank E, but he was still a close-combat type Hunter so his physique came in handy in situations like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a little bit further!! A bit more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo kept an eye out on the god statues movements and ran even harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His speed increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when the distance remaining between him and the stone statue was mere a dozen feet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, thats the wrong one!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Mister Song cried out to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo had been paying attention to the god statue only; he was stunned by the shout and hurriedly turned his head take a look at his front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahh!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its not a statue with an instrument?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He belatedly realised that the thing that looked like a musical instrument from afar was actually a shield, instead. And sure enough, the statue mercilessly stabbed down with its shield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heok!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo hurriedly threw himself to the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kkyahhk!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo rolled on the ground and when he came to a stop, he raised his head to see the god statue standing right in front of his nose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its one thing after another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His forehead mustve been torn from him rolling on the ground, because blood was flowing down and blurred his vision. His view was restricted and he couldnt look too far away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo quickly searched around his vicinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An instrument. an instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, no matter how hard he looked, he couldnt see a single statue holding an instrument nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the god statue raised its leg over Jin-Woos position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo threw himself again and somehow avoided the foot of the statue again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he had reached his limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A powerful dizziness was assaulting him and for some reason, he couldnt even balance himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there was a real god, he thought that hed start praying right about now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then, Jin-Woo spotted a stone statue that held neither a weapon or a musical instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo decided to bet everything on that statue. He crawled on the ground and arrived in front of the statue in question. He then managed to flip his body around and lied down on the ground so he could see the god statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He no longer had any energy to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, pant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo stared at the approaching god statue and continued to roughly breathe in and out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expression of the god statue was far more contorted compared to before as if it got infuriated further by Jin-Woos continued evasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The god statue now stopped in front of Jin-Woo. Seeing a creature as big as a high-rise blocking his entire view, Jin-Woo felt like he couldnt breathe anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, pant..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did it think he was nothing more than a cornered rat? The god statue simply looked down at him and didnt do anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo sensed his own unavoidable death approaching closer after looking straight into the eyes of the god statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu-wu-wu.V/\\\\IssT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n)./ for the b/est novel reading experi/en/ce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From somewhere behind him, a beautiful and otherworldly voice came out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo turned his head around to see what was going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu-wu, wu-wu-wu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lips of the stone statue holding a book moved, and whenever they did, a divine song flowed out and filled the interior of the massive chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu-wu-wu, wu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crumpled expression of the god statue slowly reverted back to the emotionless state. Soon, all those horrifyingly contorted facial muscles of the stature smoothed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the song of the stone statues came to its eventual end, the god statue turned around. Then, just how other stone statues had done until now, it returned to its throne and settled down as if things that happened until now were nothing but a lie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The noise of the god statue sitting down on the throne resounded throughout the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pant, pant.. Barely, made, it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A thin smile formed on Jin-Woos lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Ju-Hui began running from her position at the far end of the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Jin-Woo!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She ran with all her might and knelt down next to him as tears streamed down on her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can I do. What am I supposed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She summoned all of her magical energy and activated her healing magic. However, nothing seemed to improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dispersed Hunters gathered around Jin-Woo one by one. Every single one of them carried a dark expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Mister Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, only Ju-Hui was crying in sorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why was everyone acting like this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos lips bobbled up and down. He wanted to ask what was going on, but he couldnt really summon forth his own voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensing that he had no choice, he tried to prop himself up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, he noticed the pool of blood around his lower torso. Only then did he belatedly realise the change to his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below his right knee was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos eyes reflexively shifted toward the stone statue holding the shield. He then saw the trail of blood clearly visible on the end of the shield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the rest of his right leg was just below that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drip. Drip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drops of blood started falling from Ju-Huis nose. That was the sign of her reaching the limits of her physical stamina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The healing magic from a rank B Healer was unable to recover missing limbs. Meaning, what she was doing was basically pouring water into a broken jug. Her stamina rapidly bottomed out in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its fine now Miss Ju-Hui. You can stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im going to heal you!! Ill fix you as good as new!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters stared at the two of them while forming miserable expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the seventeen who initially entered this chamber only six remained now. And from this group of six, two of them had suffered horrible, grievous wounds. Song had lost his arm, while Jin-Woo lost his leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They might have survived, but none of them felt like rejoicing at the moment. It was then, yet another strange noise rocked the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUMBLE.!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle of the temple, where that strange magic formation could be found, suddenly rose up above the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo inwardly thought that it had finally come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prove your piety, is it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He already had a rough idea as to what those words could mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 5: Final Trial</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circular magic formation in the centre of the temple began rising up noisily and only stopped after reaching the height of a couple of steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An altar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters displayed alert reactions as soon as Jin-Woo muttered out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An altar.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He just said its an altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The person who had rescued them from the two preceding crises was not some high ranked Hunter, but rank E Jin-Woo, who used to be the butt of their jokes most of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it werent for Mister Seong, all of us would have been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters were thinking this exact same thought. Under the current circumstances, Jin-Woos words were their lifeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now, that Jin-Woo had muttered out a word altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim always was quick on the uptake and so, he caught onto the meaning first before anyone else had the chance to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I get it now. I see how it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim then unsheathed the sword hanging on his hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now originally, this weapon would be used to cut various monsters down. But for now, itd have to be utilised for a different purpose altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if Im a dumb b*stard, I can more or less get what youre trying to say here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters nervously swallowed their saliva while looking at the sharp, coldly-gleaming blade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oii, Mister Kim. Why are you pulling your sword out like that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why dont we talk about this first? Lets talk first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highest ranked member among the group, rank C Hunter Song was heavily injured, meaning there was no one here that could potentially stop Kim, who boasted a pretty powerful set of skills himself even within the D rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim pointed towards the altar with his sword.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final law, prove your piety. And theres an altar appearing out of nowhere in the middle of this place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kims gaze then shifted to Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, arent we supposed to offer up a sacrifice? Mister Seong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo slowly nodded his head. That was what the youth thought as well. One of the surviving six had to act as a sacrifice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thats what the last law probably meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo came to this conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sensed more disturbance and raised his head, and realised that the eyes of Mister Kim as he approached closer did not look friendly at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long sweatdrop glided down Jin-Woos forehead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahjussi What.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You, young man, dont say anything and be still!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim angrily shouted out and pointed his sword at Mister Song, who was squatting next to Jin-Woo in order to check out the youths condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just who was it that dragged us to this place? Wasnt it this guy? Yes, it was Mister Song! So, dont you think its only right for Mister Song to take the ultimate responsibility?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahjussi!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo tried to get up in a fit of anger, but then, Songs hand that resembled the bark of an aged tree stopped the youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo looked at Song in disbelief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song wordlessly shook his head. His eyes were pleading with Jin-Woo, asking the youth to not say anything else. Of course, Jin-Woo had lots of things to say, but he kept them down for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song slowly raised his body up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Mister Kim said is right. I should take the blame for today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old man, I guess we are now finally on the same page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim used the tip of his sword to point towards the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get it now, then lets get going already. Over ten people died here because of you, old man.</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 17:39:43', '2025-04-15 17:39:43'),
(29, 15, 'Chapter 6', 'chapter-6', '<p>One of the dead Hunters today happened to be Mister Park, a personal friend to Mister Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring the dual dungeon was decided with the vote involving everyone, but Kim had already erased that memory off his head after losing much of his reasoning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Song spoke to Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Id like to walk on my own volition, so can you put the sword away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Kim refused right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can I trust you, old man? Stop wasting time and start moving already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song sighed softly under his breath and walked towards the altar. Kim pointed his sword at the older mans back and followed on afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo bit his lower lip while watching the two men walk away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isnt the fault of Mister Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than half of the group agreed to do it together. Just because things had gone south, blaming Song for everything was simply too cowardly, he thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo unfortunately did not possess enough strength to stop Kim here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim, thought to be one of the best among the rank D, and Seong Jin-Woo, easily the worst of the rank E. The difference in their strengths was all too clear for him to see. Not only that, Jin-Woo had even lost a leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he tried to confront Kim as he was now, there was a chance that him and even Ju-Hui, who had been focusing solely on healing him, could meet with disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D*mn it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo squeezed his eyes shut. He never hated his own powerlessness as much as he did today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, Song had stepped up on the raised altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, a red flame lit up near the outer perimeter of the altar as soon as he did. Everyone nervously swallowed their saliva and observed the unfolding situation carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, nothing else happened. Just a single flame came to life, and that was it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They waited for a while but there was no visible change at all. Not only Kim, but everyone else got flustered by this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim quickly turned his head and spoke to Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look here, Mister Seong. This wasnt it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo also shook his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He too thought that once a person chosen as the sacrifice stepped up on the altar, the third law of prove ones piety would be completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its not about offering up a sacrifice?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If so, then it was not necessarily bad news. If the law was not about sacrifices, then it meant Mister Song could still saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woos expression brightened somewhat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sweated bucket-loads as he tried to stand up, and two Hunters nearby quickly lent their assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please take me closer to the altar so I can study it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Jin-Woo, your injuries are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui also got up from her spot to follow after Jin-Woo. Her complexion was rather pale after expending too much of her magical energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But because she had worked so hard, Jin-Woos blood loss had been temporarily halted and the pain he felt was reduced to a barely noticeable degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gotta hurry up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current condition of Ju-Hui, Kims boiling rage, Songs injuries, and the frightened Hunters he didnt have a lot of time here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo eventually arrived at the altar with the help from other Hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets climb up on the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two Hunters flinched from his statement, but they trusted Jin-Woo and stepped up. Then, three more flames lit up. Right away, Jin-Woos eyes gleamed brightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its the same number as the people on the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mister Song and Jin-Woo, plus two others who helped the youth indeed, the flames lit up to match the number of people standing on the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it kind of looked like that these four flames were drawing a circle outside the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I take into consideration the space between the flames, two more will complete the circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed that all the remaining people had to climb up on the altar for something, anything, to get started. Jin-Woo turned his head to ask Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we wait here, do you think other Hunters will come to rescue us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Song shook his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is the seventh day since the Gate showed up. These things will start moving first before the help arrives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because its a Gate ranked D, I see that its been left alone for far too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, thats how the Association operates, isnt it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Gate would open up fully after the seventh day. The real meaning of a raid was to kill the dungeons boss monster and therefore close the Gate before that happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When failing to do so, the monsters trapped in the dungeons would be set free from the dungeon and they would be able to roam the outside world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo looked behind him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The giant god statue was still looking down on them with an overbearing, arrogant expression from its throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that thing manages to go outside, then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ensuing chaos would be unimaginable. Of course, before that happened, Hunters coming to this chamber to rescue them would all be killed by the statues first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was now sure of the fact that they could not wait here forever. Jin-Woo called out to Ju-Hui and Kim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of you, climb up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ju-Hui stepped up on the altar first. The hesitant Kim also followed suit soon afterwards. Two more flames lit up and the circle was now complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters were grandly stunned by what happened next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the hell?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whats going on here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jin-Woo had suspected, yet another change took place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the outer most edge of the altar, small blue flames floated upwards and began drawing a circle of their own as well. There looked to be at least thirty of these blue flames, placed real tightly next to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>34. 35. 36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo quickly counted them all as the blue flames completed the circle and he realised that there were 36 of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The six red flames that lit up to match the number of people. And the 36 blue flames that appeared outside them. What could be the significance behind that number?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLANG!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a warning, the resolutely-shut door suddenly opened up wide. Hunters reflexively flinched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euk!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all wanted so bad to run towards the wide-open doorway, but having seen the final moments of the choirboy Hunter, they found it hard to take the first step. If one tried to be the first, just who knew what might happen to them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyones gaze fixed on Jin-Woo as if to demand an answer from him. However, Jin-Woos lips remained tightly shut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He couldnt come up with a guess at the moment. He didnt know whether the open door was a trap, or they were now allowed to go out after they upheld the final law successfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too bad for him, just as everyone was looking at Jin-Woo, a horrifying noise filled up the entire chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creeeaaaak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heads of all six Hunters quickly snapped around to look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was that?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It, its coming closer!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those d*mn things are all moving now!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunters breathing quickened in an instant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stone statues that had only moved when a person got near were now several steps closer to the group. Jin-Woo only needed a short moment to figure out what happened, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, the statues didnt move. Its the plinths below them that moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That horrifying screech from earlier on most likely came from the plinths beneath the statues grating against the stone floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.They are not moving anymore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim wiped the droplets of sweat on his forehead as he spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While everyone was still staring at the statues, Jin-Woos focus was on the blue flames. They had been going out one by one, and three of them had flickered out of existence already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creaaakkkk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing that screech, someone cried out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wha-what was that?! Where did it come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo quickly raised his head. The noise had come from his general direction. The stone statues facing him had moved a little bit closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why only my side.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was it because he looked at somewhere else briefly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to confirm, Jin-Woo closed his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The noise resounded out again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creaaaakkk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as he opened his eyes, the noise stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the f*ck is going on here?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, what are we supposed to do about this?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo quickly shouted at others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dont take your eyes off the statues, no matter what!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he thought about it, he realised that the statues first began moving closer to the group when others were busy looking at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They creep closer when we are not looking at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was right then, another blue flame disappeared. However, there was still no discernible change to either the group or the statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cautiously raising his arm, Jin-Woo did his best not to take his eyes off the statues while checking the time with his wristwatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At an interval of one minute, a blue flame was being extinguished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue flames are the timer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was quite likely that one of the main points of the third law was to stay within the altar until all 36 blue flames died out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, as long as everyone was keeping close watch on the statues, theyd be safe. It was quite possible that no one had to die at this final huddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanting to be more accurate about the remaining time, Jin-Woo began recounting the number of blue flames once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thirty remaining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They only needed to endure thirty more minutes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, Jin-Woo made a huge mistake, just then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While he was counting the number of blue flames, his eyes wandered away for a brief moment, and that resulted in the statues creeping closer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creeeakkkk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euuuh, uwaaaahhh!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man standing on the opposite side screamed and ran towards the door. He simply couldnt hold on any longer as the horrifying screeching noise coming from his back frightened him so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as he left the altar, one of the red flames disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo cried out urgently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the man running as if he had gone crazy escaped through the open doorway without meeting a grizzly fate, which took everyone by surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, what the hell?! Mister Seong! Whats going on? That guy made it out alive!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim shouted out, flustered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo was standing with his back to the doorway so he couldnt really tell what was going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did something change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door. The door has closed just a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doors closing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, no. After that guy left, the door moved a little bit, but then stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo then recalled one of the red flames disappearing as soon as that man left the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God d*mn it!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He immediately felt his heart go cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the questions that he couldnt quite figure out until now as he stood on top of this altar finally had an answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could standing on an altar be a proof of ones piety?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, he now had the answer to this quandary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that answer was probably the worst one for Jin-Woo, who had only one leg now and needed others help just to keep his balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That open doorway was a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A false hope right in front of ones eyes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If people saw the open door and climbed off the altar at the same time, the red flames wouldve gone out and the doorway would be closed shut again. And then, the banquet of raining blood and screams would inevitably follow next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the altar was the proverbial promised land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If each one did what they had to do in their positions until the timer ran out, then their survival would be guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it was between the false hope right in front of ones eyes, or the unseen promise of salvation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third law was a test to see if one could defend ones position without falling into the sweet temptation over yonder while constantly being under the encroaching threat of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, two flies in the ointment happened in this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first one was Jin-Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, the remaining group of people wouldve ran straight for the open door, but they stopped first to listen to what Jin-Woo had to say and that helped them avoid the trap being sprung in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got lucky there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, that had to be the only explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a thing was only possible because Jin-Woo managed to figure out the first two laws all by himself and earned the trust of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for him, the second fly also happened something he didnt foresee: a deserter had appeared among their midst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How would human beings react when there was a hope of survival right in front of their eyes? It was way too obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man helping Jin-Woo up abandoned the youth and bolted as well. Song hurriedly reached out and propped Jin-Woo up from his back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When that man left the altar, yet another red flame disappeared and as expected, the door closed a little bit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creeeaaakkk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh?!Uh!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim dazedly pointed at the second deserter, but just like the first person to abandon them, he too safely escaped past the doorway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jin-Woo confirmed the number of remaining red flames and shouted out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must not move! Any more than this, then itll be the end!Ra latst ch/p/ters on n/v//l(b)i(.)c//m</p>', 6, '2025-04-15 17:40:25', '2025-04-15 17:40:25');

(30, 16, 'Chapter 1: The Shattered Moon', 'chapter-1-the-shattered-moon', '<hr />\r\n<p data-end=\"843\" data-start=\"205\">The sky above had always been a constant&mdash;a symbol of both hope and eternity. But that was before. Now, it was a fractured canvas, marred by the moon&#39;s destruction. Kai Voss stood atop a crumbled skyscraper, gazing at the remnants of the Moon hanging in the sky like a broken, silent omen. The explosion had been a shockwave of unimaginable force, not just an event but the end of an era. The Moon was gone, obliterated by something far beyond human comprehension. It had left behind nothing but shards, floating fragments suspended in the void&mdash;each one carrying an undeniable force, an energy that had awakened something in the survivors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1408\" data-start=\"845\">The world had fallen apart in the days that followed. Governments had crumbled. Cities had been swallowed by chaos, their streets running with panic and violence. The destruction wasn&rsquo;t just physical. It was deeper. It was a wound that ran through time and space itself, an irreversible fracture that had unleashed powers in those few who survived. Superhuman abilities, raw and untamed, surged from the fragments that rained down from the Moon. Some of these powers were subtle, others were devastatingly destructive. And for some, the cost was too high to bear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1756\" data-start=\"1410\">Kai flexed his fingers as he looked at his own hand. He didn&rsquo;t recognize it anymore. The power the fragment had given him&mdash;the ability to twist time itself&mdash;was both a gift and a curse. It had been the very thing that saved him from a failed mission years ago. A mission that had left him stranded on the Moon just as the world began to fall apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2192\" data-start=\"1758\">He had been there. In the depths of space, alone with only the stars as his companions. The Earth had seemed so distant, so far away. Then the explosion came, the blast so powerful that it reached him even on the Moon. The impact had shattered the satellite, splitting it into pieces, and with it, everything on Earth had begun to unravel. He had watched in silence, the only survivor, the only witness to the birth of the apocalypse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2614\" data-start=\"2194\">When the fragments hit Earth, everything changed. People began to awaken to powers&mdash;abilities that weren&rsquo;t just strange, but dangerous. With every use of these powers, something in the world broke. The very fabric of reality seemed to unravel, and every time Kai used his ability to manipulate time, he could feel the rift growing wider. A part of him wondered how long before time itself would collapse under the strain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2905\" data-start=\"2616\">Kai had spent weeks in hiding, trying to figure out how to control the power within him. He had barely scratched the surface of what the fragment could do, but every time he pushed its limits, he could feel the distortion&mdash;the way the world around him bent, twisted, and threatened to snap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3125\" data-start=\"2907\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use it,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. He knew the cost of his power, knew that every second he rewound or accelerated left a scar on reality. But he wasn&rsquo;t here by choice. He had to keep moving, had to keep fighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3326\" data-start=\"3127\">A flicker of movement caught his attention. He turned sharply to the side, his hand instinctively going to the fragment embedded in his arm. The pulse was faint, but it was there. Someone was nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3638\" data-start=\"3328\">Ava Marlowe stepped out from the shadows. Her military gear was worn and frayed, a testament to the battles she had fought, the wars she had survived. Unlike Kai, she didn&rsquo;t possess a fragment&rsquo;s power. But her sharp instincts, strategic mind, and the scars of a world gone to hell made her an invaluable ally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3735\" data-start=\"3640\">&ldquo;You know, standing up here isn&rsquo;t going to bring it back,&rdquo; Ava said, her voice quiet, but firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4144\" data-start=\"3737\">Kai didn&rsquo;t respond immediately. He just stared at the fragments of the Moon that hung in the sky, each piece a beacon of a world beyond his reach. He could feel the weight of the loss in his bones. Humanity had always been defined by its reach toward the stars, by the pursuit of knowledge and progress. But now, with the Moon shattered, that reach had been severed, leaving only darkness and broken pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not waiting for it to come back,&rdquo; he said, his voice low. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for the dust to settle. For the world to make sense again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4563\" data-start=\"4283\">Ava shook her head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t. Not unless we fight for it. We&rsquo;re not the only ones with powers. There are others, people who want to control the fragments. People who would burn this world to the ground just to get what they want. We need to find them first. Before they find us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4940\" data-start=\"4565\">Kai turned to face her, a mixture of determination and weariness in his eyes. He had heard the rumors, seen the signs. A faction, led by a shadowy figure known only as M, was hunting the fragments. They weren&rsquo;t interested in saving humanity. They were interested in control. And if they got their hands on the fragments, they could reshape the world&mdash;or destroy it altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5013\" data-start=\"4942\">&ldquo;Do you think we can stop them?&rdquo; Kai asked, his voice thick with doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5102\" data-start=\"5015\">&ldquo;We have to,&rdquo; Ava replied, her gaze unwavering. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the last chance this world has.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5544\" data-start=\"5104\">Kai clenched his fists, feeling the familiar pulse of power within him. He knew the world had already been broken beyond repair, but somehow, in the deep recesses of his mind, there was still a flicker of hope. It was faint, fragile, but it was there. The fragments had granted him power. Now, it was time to decide whether to use it to fix what had been torn apart or let the world collapse further under the weight of its own destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5690\" data-start=\"5546\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, his voice firm with resolve. &ldquo;But we do this my way. We find the fragments, and we use them carefully. No more mistakes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5778\" data-start=\"5692\">Ava nodded, her expression a mixture of hope and skepticism. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get to work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6116\" data-start=\"5780\">Kai didn&rsquo;t look at her as they walked away from the crumbled edge of the skyscraper. His eyes were fixed on the horizon, where the distant shards of the Moon glowed faintly in the sky. Time was running out, and if they didn&rsquo;t act soon, the forces hunting them would tear the world apart before they had a chance to put it back together.</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 17:53:52', '2025-04-15 17:53:52'),
(31, 16, 'Chapter 2: Temporal Shatter', 'chapter-2-temporal-shatter', '<p>The air felt thick with uncertainty as Kai made his way through the wreckage of the old city. The streets, once bustling with life, now lay dormant, consumed by the wreckage of buildings and the remnants of a civilization that had been torn apart. Every step he took seemed to echo in the silence, the only sound being the wind, which howled like a dying animal through the hollowed-out husks of skyscrapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"920\" data-start=\"623\">His boots crunched over broken glass and rubble, and the distant flicker of dim streetlights cast long, crooked shadows on the streets. It was strange. The city was eerily quiet, yet it felt like everything was holding its breath, waiting for something. For him. For the power that lay inside him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1300\" data-start=\"922\">Kai could feel it again. The fragment in his arm, that cursed gift from the Moon&rsquo;s destruction. It pulsed, faint but distinct, beneath his skin. A reminder of the power that had reshaped everything. The one thing that could have saved him... and the one thing that threatened to undo him. He flexed his hand, almost instinctively, and the power seemed to stir beneath his flesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1333\" data-start=\"1302\"><em data-end=\"1315\" data-start=\"1302\">Don&rsquo;t do it</em>, he told himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1669\" data-start=\"1335\">But it was getting harder and harder to resist. He could feel the temptation to use it. He was walking down the street now, heading towards the warehouse Ava had mentioned. The night was darker than usual. The moon, or what was left of it, was a constant presence above the fractured skyline, a haunting reminder of what had happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1761\" data-start=\"1671\">He remembered the first time he used the power&mdash;the first time the fragment had activated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2144\" data-start=\"1763\">It had been an accident. He had been caught in the wreckage of a collapsed building, a pile of debris pinning him beneath it. He had thought he was going to die there, crushed under the weight of the collapse, but then the fragment within him had reacted. A split-second instinct. He had reached out with his hand, desperate to save himself, and suddenly... everything had stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2162\" data-start=\"2146\">Time had frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2543\" data-start=\"2164\">The air around him had grown still, as though the world itself had taken a breath and held it. He had felt it first in his chest, then spread through his limbs, like the very essence of time was being bent and pulled through him. The debris had ceased its fall, hanging motionless in the air. He could see the world around him&mdash;a frozen tableau, frozen people, frozen everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that moment, he had thought it was a miracle. A gift. But then he had moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2645\" data-start=\"2626\">He hadn&rsquo;t meant to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2872\" data-start=\"2647\">But just the simple action of reaching out had sent time spiraling backward. The rubble had reversed itself, falling back into place, shifting in a way that was unnatural. The damage had undone itself. But only for a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3241\" data-start=\"2874\">He had thought it was magic&mdash;something impossible. But there was nothing magical about it. It had a cost. And when time resumed its flow, the city had been different. The air had felt thicker, as though reality itself had been stretched too thin. That was when he understood. Time couldn&rsquo;t be rewound without consequences. And those consequences were starting to show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3384\" data-start=\"3243\">He had used the power twice since then, but each time it had left him weaker. More disoriented. More disconnected from the world around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3639\" data-start=\"3386\">As Kai reached the entrance to the abandoned warehouse, he could feel it. The pulse in his arm was stronger now, almost as if it was calling to him. It throbbed with an insistent, almost painful rhythm. The power was hungry. It wanted to be used again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4150\" data-start=\"3641\">Kai stopped in his tracks, his eyes closing briefly as he forced himself to breathe. He had to stay focused. He wasn&rsquo;t here for himself. He was here for the mission&mdash;finding fragments before the faction did. Ava had made it clear that they needed to locate the remaining fragments scattered across the city. If they didn&rsquo;t, someone else would. And that someone else had no interest in saving the world. M&rsquo;s faction had one goal&mdash;to use the fragments to reshape everything according to their own twisted design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4257\" data-start=\"4152\">Kai wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was ready to stop them. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he had the strength left to fight at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4635\" data-start=\"4259\">He approached the entrance cautiously, each step deliberate, knowing that he was far from alone. His senses were heightened, alert to every shift in the air, every crackle of movement in the shadows. He could feel eyes on him, could almost hear the whispers of those watching from afar. The city wasn&rsquo;t silent after all. It was alive with danger, waiting for the next misstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4909\" data-start=\"4637\">As he reached the doorway, he paused. His fingers hovered over the latch, then froze. The fragment in his arm pulsed violently, sending a sharp pain racing through his chest. He staggered back, gripping his arm tightly, trying to suppress the power before it surged again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5155\" data-start=\"4911\">He took a few shallow breaths, feeling the world spin around him. His vision blurred for a moment, the edges of the world warping like ripples on water. His pulse was erratic, his thoughts scattered. His powers were becoming harder to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5268\" data-start=\"5157\">He had to be careful. He had to resist the temptation to use it again. He couldn&rsquo;t let it consume him. Not now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5568\" data-start=\"5270\">With a strained effort, Kai stepped forward once more, forcing himself to focus. The door creaked open, revealing the dark interior of the warehouse. The faint scent of rust and old machinery filled his nostrils. There was no sign of movement, no immediate danger. But that didn&rsquo;t mean he was safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5907\" data-start=\"5570\">The fragment within him throbbed again, a constant reminder that danger wasn&rsquo;t just outside&mdash;it was inside him. Every time he used his power, every time he bent time to his will, the world around him seemed to break a little more. The threads of reality twisted and snapped, and there was no telling what would happen if he kept using it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6118\" data-start=\"5909\">Inside the warehouse, rows of dusty crates and old equipment lined the walls. A low hum filled the air, and as Kai stepped deeper into the space, his footfalls were muffled by the thick dust coating the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6362\" data-start=\"6120\">He moved cautiously, scanning his surroundings. The mission was simple&mdash;find the fragments before anyone else did. But nothing was ever simple anymore. He could feel it. There was something more to this place. Something he hadn&rsquo;t anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6542\" data-start=\"6364\">As he approached the far corner, he heard a sound&mdash;a soft scraping noise, followed by a quiet gasp. Kai&rsquo;s instincts kicked in. He spun around, his body tensing, ready for a fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6646\" data-start=\"6544\">Before he could react, a figure stepped out of the shadows, raising their hands in a gesture of peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6728\" data-start=\"6648\">&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; the person said, their voice low and cautious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to fight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6792\" data-start=\"6730\">Kai narrowed his eyes, still poised for action. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6929\" data-start=\"6794\">The figure stepped into the light, revealing a young man with dark hair and an expression that matched the broken world they inhabited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6995\" data-start=\"6931\">&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Leo. I&rsquo;m not with M&rsquo;s faction. But I need your help.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7234\" data-start=\"6997\">Kai didn&rsquo;t trust him. But he knew one thing for sure: this was no coincidence. The fragments had brought them together for a reason. Whether it was fate or something darker, Kai couldn&rsquo;t say. But he did know this&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t alone anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7337\" data-start=\"7236\">And if he was going to survive, he would have to face whatever dangers lay ahead, no matter the cost.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 17:54:17', '2025-04-15 17:54:17'),
(32, 16, 'Chapter 3: The Shattered Path', 'chapter-3-the-shattered-path', '<p>The world felt different now. Even the air seemed thick, heavy with the burden of everything that had happened. Kai hadn&rsquo;t been back to the city since the Moon had exploded. There were no familiar landmarks anymore, only the skeletal remains of structures, twisted metal, and buildings that had once been symbols of progress and ambition. The streets that had once been filled with life were now hollow&mdash;silent. The few survivors that remained had scattered, trying to survive in this new reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"689\" data-start=\"658\">But Kai wasn&rsquo;t here to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"715\" data-start=\"691\">He was here to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1126\" data-start=\"717\">&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;re being followed?&rdquo; Ava&rsquo;s voice broke through the silence, bringing Kai&rsquo;s attention back to the present. She was walking a few steps ahead, her eyes constantly scanning the surroundings, always alert. She had become sharper, more wary since the explosion, and Kai could see the strain in her movements. This wasn&rsquo;t the world they had known; it was something darker. And Ava wasn&rsquo;t one to take risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1434\" data-start=\"1128\">Kai&rsquo;s hand rested on the fragment embedded deep within his arm. It was more than just a physical object&mdash;it had become a part of him. The power it granted him was both a gift and a curse. A temptation he fought daily. Each day without using it felt like a small victory. But today&hellip; today might be different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1568\" data-start=\"1436\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I feel like we&rsquo;re being watched,&rdquo; Kai replied, his voice steady but with an underlying edge. &ldquo;We should keep moving.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1740\" data-start=\"1570\">Ava nodded, but the slight twitch of her hand on the gun at her side showed she didn&rsquo;t entirely agree. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to use that power again, Kai. We&rsquo;re not there yet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2127\" data-start=\"1742\">Kai&rsquo;s jaw tightened, and he clenched his fist, feeling the fragment pulse beneath his skin. She didn&rsquo;t understand. Every time they took another step forward, every time they ventured further into the heart of the chaos, it became harder to resist. The fragment was more than just a source of power. It was a constant, aching pull that threatened to break him with every passing second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2390\" data-start=\"2129\">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, though it wasn&rsquo;t directed at her. The city was alive with danger&mdash;an invisible threat in the shadows. It felt like every corner hid a watcher, every broken streetlamp a hiding place for someone waiting for them to slip up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they walked further into the decaying city, the tension in the air grew thicker. They passed through alleyways lined with forgotten debris, remnants of a world long gone. The buildings stretched far above them, towering yet hollow, their windows empty and dark. There was no sound, no sign of life except for the wind whispering through the rubble. It was as though the city had been abandoned to the past, left to decay and wither away in the wake of the Moon&rsquo;s destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3310\" data-start=\"2872\">Ava stopped in front of a shattered storefront. The sign, once bright and welcoming, was now little more than a rusted frame hanging loosely from the wall. A few faint traces of the word &quot;Market&quot; could still be seen on the remnants of the sign, but everything beneath it had been consumed by dust. She examined the entrance carefully before turning back to Kai. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re close. According to the maps, there&rsquo;s a safehouse not far from here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3653\" data-start=\"3312\">Kai nodded but didn&rsquo;t reply. He couldn&rsquo;t focus on the safehouse, not right now. There was a deeper, more urgent feeling gnawing at him, one that didn&rsquo;t stem from hunger or fatigue. It was the pull of the fragment, urging him to use it. He could feel it deep in his bones, a quiet hum beneath his skin that threatened to escalate into a roar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3985\" data-start=\"3655\">He glanced at Ava, who was inspecting the area, clearly unaware of the war that was waging inside him. He wished he could tell her, but he knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t understand. She couldn&rsquo;t. None of them could. Not unless they had felt the power firsthand, unless they had the fragment embedded deep inside them, begging to be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4406\" data-start=\"3987\">The last time Kai had used the fragment to alter time, the world had almost folded in on itself. He had been able to save a few innocent lives, but at what cost? The very fabric of reality had rippled in response to his actions, bending and twisting, creating a rift that had left him physically drained and emotionally torn. And with each passing day, the power only seemed to grow stronger, more difficult to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4527\" data-start=\"4408\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right behind you,&rdquo; Kai said, shaking off the unease that had been rising in him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the safehouse.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4968\" data-start=\"4529\">Ava didn&rsquo;t argue. She turned and entered the building, moving quickly and silently. Kai followed, staying a few steps behind, his eyes scanning the space around him for any signs of movement. The interior of the safehouse was nothing more than an abandoned store with makeshift barricades, but it had once served as a refuge for survivors. It smelled of mildew and decay, but it was shelter, and for the moment, that was all that mattered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5192\" data-start=\"4970\">The flickering of a light bulb overhead did little to dispel the shadows in the room, and Kai&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he crossed the threshold. His senses were on high alert. The place felt off, but there was no time to waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5410\" data-start=\"5194\">&ldquo;Anyone here?&rdquo; Ava&rsquo;s voice echoed through the empty building, but no answer came. Her hand hovered near her gun, ready for anything. She stepped further into the room, her boots clicking softly on the concrete floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5878\" data-start=\"5412\">Kai moved to a corner, his back against the wall as he let his gaze drift across the room. The safehouse was eerily quiet. The few pieces of furniture that had once provided comfort to its occupants were now overturned or broken, left as the last remnants of a once-functional world. Kai had seen places like this before, abandoned by survivors in the face of greater threats. The problem with a world like theirs was that no safe place was ever truly safe for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5935\" data-start=\"5880\">Then, a voice broke the silence. Low. Cold. Unfamiliar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5961\" data-start=\"5937\">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6238\" data-start=\"5963\">Kai&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat, and instinctively, he reached for the fragment embedded in his arm. The power pulsed stronger now, urging him to act. To use it. His fingers curled tighter around the shard of stone lodged deep in his flesh, but he held back. This wasn&rsquo;t the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6336\" data-start=\"6240\">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Ava demanded, her voice sharp. She moved into a defensive stance, her gun raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6515\" data-start=\"6338\">The figure stepped from the shadows. The man was tall, his face obscured by a hood and scarf, his posture threatening but composed. His eyes, cold and calculating, fixed on Kai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6648\" data-start=\"6517\">&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; The figure&rsquo;s voice was gravelly, almost as if he had not spoken in years. &ldquo;What matters is that you&rsquo;re too late.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6863\" data-start=\"6650\">Kai felt the air grow thick with tension. The man wasn&rsquo;t alone. There were others hidden in the shadows, just out of sight. They hadn&rsquo;t heard him coming, and now he realized that they had walked right into a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6913\" data-start=\"6865\">Ava&rsquo;s eyes flicked to Kai. &ldquo;We need to go. Now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6943\" data-start=\"6915\">But it was already too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7220\" data-start=\"6945\">The man took a step forward, his hand lifting to reveal a fragment of the Moon. It gleamed darkly in his palm, reflecting the broken light from above. The sight of it made Kai&rsquo;s chest tighten. He wasn&rsquo;t the only one with this power. The others were hunting the fragments too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7584\" data-start=\"7222\">Kai didn&rsquo;t wait. In one swift motion, he grabbed Ava&rsquo;s arm and pulled her toward the back exit. His heart pounded in his chest, and his breath came in ragged gasps as the world around him seemed to bend. The fragment pulsed again, harder this time, and he felt the pressure building&mdash;time wanted to break free. But there was no time to use it, no time to risk it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7654\" data-start=\"7586\">&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; he yelled, pushing Ava toward the door. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7828\" data-start=\"7656\">They didn&rsquo;t look back as they burst through the door and into the dark alley behind the building, but Kai could hear the footsteps echoing behind them. The chase had begun.</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 17:54:45', '2025-04-15 17:54:45'),
(33, 16, 'Chapter 4: The Fragmented Pursuit', 'chapter-4-the-fragmented-pursuit', '<p data-end=\"661\" data-start=\"178\">The alley was narrow and filled with the remnants of a crumbled city. What had once been a thriving marketplace was now nothing more than a maze of ruins, rotting food, overturned carts, and shattered glass. Kai&rsquo;s boots slapped against the wet concrete as he pulled Ava with him, the weight of urgency driving his every step. The night air was thick with the scent of decay and the distant hum of the city&rsquo;s collapse. Somewhere far behind them, a flicker of movement caught his eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"688\" data-start=\"663\">They were being followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"778\" data-start=\"690\">Ava stumbled slightly, but Kai steadied her with one hand. &ldquo;Keep moving. We can&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1062\" data-start=\"780\">Ava didn&rsquo;t need telling twice. Her training kicked in as she pushed forward, her eyes darting from side to side, scanning every possible escape route. &ldquo;Who were those people back there?&rdquo; she asked, her voice sharp but with a hint of curiosity. &ldquo;They had fragments too, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1327\" data-start=\"1064\">Kai&rsquo;s jaw tightened, the pulse of his own fragment sending a low, vibrating hum through his veins. He knew the answer to her question. Whoever they were, they were not here for survival&mdash;they were hunting. And that meant they wanted the fragments. Kai&rsquo;s fragment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1679\" data-start=\"1329\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who they were, but they&rsquo;re dangerous,&rdquo; Kai replied, his voice rough. He spared a quick glance over his shoulder, half-expecting to see their pursuers. The shadows seemed to stretch, and the city&rsquo;s broken skyline loomed above them like jagged teeth, closing in. &ldquo;We need to find somewhere to hide, regroup, and figure out our next move.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1918\" data-start=\"1681\">But Ava wasn&rsquo;t listening. She&rsquo;d already spotted an old warehouse up ahead, its roof barely standing but its walls intact. A rusted sign hung crookedly above the entrance, the letters faded but still visible: &ldquo;Abandoned Storage Facility.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2128\" data-start=\"1920\">Without hesitation, she motioned for Kai to follow and ran toward the building. The doors were ajar, creaking with the weight of neglect. Kai didn&rsquo;t hesitate. He followed her inside, his senses on high alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2562\" data-start=\"2130\">The inside of the warehouse was dark and musty, the air thick with dust and the smell of mildew. Broken crates were scattered across the floor, their contents long since looted or ruined. The only sound was the distant hum of the wind outside and the occasional creak of the metal beams overhead. But something was off. The hairs on the back of Kai&rsquo;s neck stood up, and he instinctively reached for the fragment embedded in his arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2732\" data-start=\"2564\">&ldquo;You feel that?&rdquo; he whispered, eyes scanning the shadows. Ava stopped, her breath catching slightly. She glanced at him, and they shared a brief look of understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2787\" data-start=\"2734\">A noise echoed in the distance&mdash;footsteps. Too close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2946\" data-start=\"2789\">&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Ava muttered under her breath, pulling Kai further into the shadows at the back of the warehouse. They crouched low behind a stack of old crates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3185\" data-start=\"2948\">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t outrun them forever,&rdquo; Kai said, his voice steady, though a storm of thoughts churned in his mind. &ldquo;And the fragment&hellip;&rdquo; His voice trailed off. He could feel the familiar hum growing stronger, urging him to act, to use the power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ava shot him a sharp look. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t risk it, Kai. Not yet. The more you use that power, the closer you come to breaking it. If you shatter time too much&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3628\" data-start=\"3345\">Kai closed his eyes, grinding his teeth. He knew. He had felt the fractures, the way reality bent and wavered under his influence. But what choice did he have? Every second counted. The world was breaking around them, and the powers unleashed by the fragments were tearing it apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3960\" data-start=\"3630\">Before he could answer, the door to the warehouse creaked open, and a figure stepped inside. It was the same man from before&mdash;the one with the hooded cloak, his face obscured, the faint glow of the fragment in his hand. His cold eyes scanned the space with practiced precision, and his gaze lingered on the far corner of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4236\" data-start=\"3962\">Kai held his breath, his heart pounding in his chest. The man&rsquo;s presence was suffocating, as if he carried a storm with him. Kai could feel it deep within him&mdash;the temptation to reach out, to stretch time, to pull the fragments from the air and stop this before it escalated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4254\" data-start=\"4238\">But no. Not yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4498\" data-start=\"4256\">The man took a slow step forward, then stopped, his head tilting slightly as if listening for something. Kai&rsquo;s grip on the fragment tightened, his pulse racing. Ava was silent beside him, her gun in hand, but she didn&rsquo;t move. She understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4632\" data-start=\"4500\">The stranger&rsquo;s eyes flicked toward the shadows, where Kai and Ava hid. There was a pause&mdash;just long enough for Kai to brace himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4727\" data-start=\"4634\">And then, the man spoke. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re here. Come out, and I promise we&rsquo;ll make this quick.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4922\" data-start=\"4729\">Kai could feel the fragments, their distant power tugging at him like a gravitational pull. His fingers twitched, and the world seemed to hold its breath. If he moved now, if he used the power&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5095\" data-start=\"4924\">&ldquo;Your move, Kai,&rdquo; the man continued, his voice soft, almost mocking. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll use it, won&rsquo;t you? I can feel it. The pull of the fragment. You&rsquo;re not like the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5139\" data-start=\"5097\">Kai&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. The man knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5243\" data-start=\"5141\">Ava&rsquo;s hand pressed against his arm, the pressure grounding him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered fiercely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5458\" data-start=\"5245\">But it was too late. The fragment was no longer a whisper&mdash;it was a scream in his mind. He could feel it bending time, pulling him toward action, toward the one thing he knew could change the course of everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai shut his eyes for a brief moment, his breath shallow as he fought against the force. He had to do this. He had to protect Ava. But the cost&mdash;it would be more than he could bear. It always was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5686\" data-start=\"5657\">Then, the man lunged forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5994\" data-start=\"5688\">Kai reacted instantly, his body moving on pure instinct. Time fractured. The world around him slowed. The man&rsquo;s movements blurred as Kai pulled time back, stretching it, pulling it backward as if it were a piece of elastic. In an instant, the man&rsquo;s figure halted mid-lunge, suspended in an unnatural pause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6071\" data-start=\"5996\">Ava gasped in disbelief as she watched the man freeze. &ldquo;Kai&mdash;what are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6306\" data-start=\"6073\">Kai didn&rsquo;t answer. His hand reached out, fingers trembling, as he stretched time further. The world around him felt warped, the fabric of reality thinning. He was treading dangerously close to the edge, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop. Not now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6675\" data-start=\"6308\">His hand clenched, and the man&rsquo;s body jerked backward, crashing into a pile of crates. The man&rsquo;s hood fell back, revealing a sharp, angular face, pale and cold as a corpse. But there was something worse than his appearance&mdash;something in the way he moved, something otherworldly. Kai could feel it in his bones, the ripple of power emanating from him like a cold wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6900\" data-start=\"6677\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a mistake,&rdquo; the man growled, rising slowly. He wiped blood from his mouth where he had slammed into the crate, but his eyes glinted with a strange, malevolent force. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7124\" data-start=\"6902\">Kai&rsquo;s heart thundered in his chest as he fought to maintain control. The strain of manipulating time was unbearable, the world around him twisting in response. But there was no going back. He had to end this, here and now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7337\" data-start=\"7126\">With a roar, the man surged forward again, but this time, Kai was ready. He reached out, pushing time forward, slamming the man into the wall with the force of a hundred moving objects. The impact was deafening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7491\" data-start=\"7339\">Ava stood frozen for a moment, watching the scene unfold. Then, as if waking from a trance, she ran forward, grabbing Kai&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Enough, Kai! Stop it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7675\" data-start=\"7493\">Kai&rsquo;s breath came in ragged gasps, the world around him flickering and warping. The man groaned but didn&rsquo;t rise. His eyes locked onto Kai, and there was a twisted smirk on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7814\" data-start=\"7677\">&ldquo;You think this will stop me? You don&rsquo;t know how far this goes,&rdquo; the man said, his voice barely audible as he faded into unconsciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8093\" data-start=\"7816\">Kai stood there, his body trembling with the aftereffects of using the fragment&rsquo;s power. He felt like he was floating, untethered, as reality snapped back into place. The room stopped spinning, and the darkness that had been creeping into the edges of his vision finally faded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8156\" data-start=\"8095\">Ava&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder brought him back. &ldquo;Kai, you okay?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8310\" data-start=\"8158\">He didn&rsquo;t answer at first. He couldn&rsquo;t. His head was spinning. Time had broken. He had used it again, and now the consequences would be even more dire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8385\" data-start=\"8312\">They had won, for now. But the chase wasn&rsquo;t over. It had only just begun.</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 17:55:12', '2025-04-15 17:55:12'),
(34, 16, 'Chapter 5: Echoes of the Past', 'chapter-5-echoes-of-the-past', '<p data-end=\"634\" data-start=\"199\">The remnants of the city were both a graveyard and a warning&mdash;a place where the past had been swallowed by chaos. As the sun dipped behind the jagged skyline, Kai and Ava trudged through the ruins, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence that had settled over the world. The shadows stretched long, bending across the broken streets, and the air was thick with dust and decay. The city was no longer a place of life, but of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"847\" data-start=\"636\">&ldquo;Is this where it all ends, Kai?&rdquo; Ava asked, her voice breaking through the oppressive silence. &ldquo;Running from one place to the next, always looking over our shoulders, never knowing who&rsquo;s going to find us next?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1252\" data-start=\"849\">Kai didn&rsquo;t have an answer. How could he? The question lingered in the air between them, but there was no real answer. He was already exhausted, his mind fractured by the constant tension of being hunted, always on the move, never resting. Each day felt like a battle&mdash;both against the world around him and the fragment embedded in his arm, which throbbed with power, pulling at him, urging him to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1507\" data-start=\"1254\">But what would that even do? He had used the fragment once, and it nearly tore the fabric of time itself. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to repeat that mistake. He didn&rsquo;t want to lose himself in it. But every day, the power grew stronger. And so did the temptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2008\" data-start=\"1509\">They were nearing the outskirts of the city, moving toward the abandoned industrial sector. If there was any hope of finding a safe haven, it would be there&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s what they had been told. The safehouses and shelters that were scattered across the city had become traps or forgotten relics, picked clean by scavengers or worse, occupied by those who sought power. The safehouses, once a glimmer of hope, were no longer places of refuge. There was no safety anymore. There was only survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2316\" data-start=\"2010\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re close,&rdquo; Ava said, her voice low. She scanned the surroundings, ever vigilant. The night was descending, and the shadows seemed to close in around them. There was an edge to the air, a tension that hadn&rsquo;t been there before. The city felt like it was watching them, waiting for them to make a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2681\" data-start=\"2318\">Kai&rsquo;s eyes darted from building to building. There was something unsettling about the way the city felt&mdash;like it was holding its breath. A part of him wanted to reach for the fragment, to twist time and figure out where the danger was coming from, but he pushed the thought aside. There was no time for that. They needed to keep moving, stay ahead of the hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2794\" data-start=\"2683\">A sharp crack echoed in the distance. Kai&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. He froze, his senses immediately sharpening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2956\" data-start=\"2796\">&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; Ava whispered, her hand instinctively going to her sidearm. She wasn&rsquo;t looking at him anymore; her gaze was fixed on the dark alley ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2988\" data-start=\"2958\">Kai nodded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not alone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3287\" data-start=\"2990\">The crack sounded again, closer this time. And then, another sound&mdash;footsteps. Light, careful, as though someone was deliberately trying to remain undetected. But Kai could feel it now&mdash;something more than just the ordinary tension of a city under siege. It was something darker. Something personal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3438\" data-start=\"3289\">&ldquo;Move.&rdquo; Ava&rsquo;s command was sharp and immediate, and they both began to move quickly, ducking into an abandoned alley between two crumbling buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3803\" data-start=\"3440\">Kai&rsquo;s mind raced as they ran, his eyes darting between the shadowed alleys and rooftops. His heart was pounding in his chest, but he knew that stopping wasn&rsquo;t an option. They had no backup, no allies. Just the two of them. And the fragments&mdash;fragments that seemed to be the only thing keeping them alive, and at the same time, pulling them toward something darker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3956\" data-start=\"3805\">The footsteps grew louder, closer now. There were more than one set of them. Kai felt his pulse quicken. Whoever was behind them, they were closing in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4124\" data-start=\"3958\">Ava stopped suddenly, pulling Kai into the shadows of a crumbled building. &ldquo;Stay low,&rdquo; she whispered, crouching down and flattening herself against the cold concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4292\" data-start=\"4126\">Kai followed suit, his heart racing as he listened to the approaching footsteps. The sound of boots on gravel, slow but deliberate, was unmistakable. They were close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4563\" data-start=\"4294\">The shadows lengthened around them, swallowing the alley as the last remnants of daylight disappeared into the horizon. Then, a figure emerged from the shadows. It wasn&rsquo;t the man from before&mdash;the one with the cloak and the fragment&mdash;but someone else. Someone unfamiliar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4885\" data-start=\"4565\">The figure moved swiftly, walking with purpose as if they had been tracking Kai and Ava for some time. They wore a long coat, the hood pulled low over their face, their footsteps muffled by the thick dust that coated the streets. Their presence was unsettling, like an echo of something that didn&rsquo;t belong in this world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5123\" data-start=\"4887\">Kai held his breath, watching the figure pass by the alley. He could feel his pulse thrumming in his ears. His body ached from the tension, from the constant fear of being found. And yet, somehow, they hadn&rsquo;t been seen&mdash;at least not yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5412\" data-start=\"5125\">Ava motioned for Kai to follow her, and they moved deeper into the alley. There was no way they could risk facing this new threat. The figure wasn&rsquo;t alone. There was a small group, at least three, spread out in a tight formation, surrounding the alley and looking for signs of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5547\" data-start=\"5414\">Ava&rsquo;s voice was barely a whisper. &ldquo;We need to keep moving, but we can&rsquo;t go back the way we came. We&rsquo;ll have to find another way out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai nodded in agreement, but something felt wrong. His instincts were screaming at him to stop, to listen, to understand what was happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5995\" data-start=\"5692\">And then, as though the city itself had chosen that moment to speak, the ground beneath their feet trembled. A low rumble echoed from deep within the earth. Kai&rsquo;s eyes widened. This wasn&rsquo;t just the normal aftershocks that had become a part of their new reality. No, this was different. This felt&hellip; alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6045\" data-start=\"5997\">Ava tensed beside him. &ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6401\" data-start=\"6047\">Before Kai could answer, the rumble came again, this time much louder, shaking the buildings around them. The ground cracked beneath their feet, and dust poured from above as if the very earth was breaking apart. The alley seemed to collapse in on itself, the walls crumbling as the ground opened up in front of them, a gaping chasm splitting the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6586\" data-start=\"6403\">&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; Kai shouted, pulling Ava away from the edge. His mind raced&mdash;this wasn&rsquo;t normal. It was the work of something far more dangerous than anything they had faced so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6726\" data-start=\"6588\">They ran. They didn&rsquo;t look back as the earth continued to quake, as the ground splintered and buckled, threatening to swallow them whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7123\" data-start=\"6728\">Kai&rsquo;s pulse pounded in his chest. The fragment in his arm throbbed with energy, almost as though it were reacting to the instability, to the chaos. He could feel the power within him stirring, but he resisted. Not yet. He couldn&rsquo;t use it again, not after the last time. But the earth was cracking wide open in front of him, and every instinct he had screamed that it was only going to get worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7429\" data-start=\"7125\">They reached the edge of the alley, where the ground seemed to be collapsing into a vast, yawning abyss. The once-sturdy buildings along the block had been reduced to rubble, their skeletal remains jutting from the earth like the remains of some ancient civilization. There was no safe place. No refuge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7475\" data-start=\"7431\">Ava grabbed his arm. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go that way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7725\" data-start=\"7477\">Kai&rsquo;s eyes scanned the horizon. There was nothing left of the city to help them now. There was only darkness ahead, but in the distance, he could see a faint glimmer of light&mdash;like the glow of a beacon. Maybe it was a survivor. Maybe it was a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7765\" data-start=\"7727\">But there was no time for hesitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7906\" data-start=\"7767\">With a grim nod, Kai led the way, pushing forward into the unknown, away from the collapse of the city, into whatever danger awaited them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7948\" data-start=\"7908\">They had no choice but to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8158\" data-start=\"7950\">And yet, Kai couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that the worst was still to come. Something in the distance&mdash;the glow of light, or perhaps the shaking earth itself&mdash;told him that the end was not behind them, but ahead.</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 17:55:41', '2025-04-15 17:55:41');

(35, 16, 'Chapter 6: Beneath the Shattered Sky', 'chapter-6-beneath-the-shattered-sky', '<p>The darkness was oppressive, a heavy blanket of uncertainty that settled over Kai and Ava as they moved deeper into the ruined streets. The collapse of the city behind them was a constant reminder of how much they had lost and how much more they could lose if they didn&rsquo;t keep moving. The ground beneath their feet felt unstable, as though the earth itself was shifting in time with the chaos that had come with the fragments. Kai could feel it in his bones, the tremors of a world in flux, in danger of tearing itself apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1154\" data-start=\"692\">The distant glow that had drawn them forward flickered like a beacon in the dark, a false promise of safety that kept them moving through the desolation. There was no way to know whether it was a survivor&rsquo;s camp, a trap, or something else entirely, but it was the only direction they had left to go. The city had been abandoned for months, and what little remained of civilization was now nothing more than scavengers and predators hunting for anything of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1354\" data-start=\"1156\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too quiet,&rdquo; Ava muttered under her breath, her voice barely audible over the sound of their footsteps. She was always on edge, her instincts razor-sharp, and Kai could feel her growing unease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1433\" data-start=\"1356\">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Kai replied, his gaze fixed on the faint light ahead. &ldquo;Stay alert.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1747\" data-start=\"1435\">Ava nodded, her hand gripping the sidearm holstered at her hip. It was a comforting gesture, though both of them knew it wouldn&rsquo;t do much if they were faced with a threat stronger than any human they&rsquo;d encountered. Kai&rsquo;s fragment was the only real weapon they had, and even that was becoming a dangerous crutch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2240\" data-start=\"1749\">They moved quickly, the shadows around them shifting as the night stretched on. The remnants of buildings loomed like towering skeletons, their shattered windows and crumbling facades adding to the sense of decay. The city had once been a marvel of human achievement, a thriving testament to civilization&rsquo;s power and innovation. Now, it was a crumbling monument to failure, and Kai wondered how long the world could hold out before it too, like everything else, fractured beyond recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2524\" data-start=\"2242\">The light grew brighter as they approached, though it was still too far to make out any details. As they neared an intersection, a familiar sensation tingled in Kai&rsquo;s chest. He stopped abruptly, holding his hand up to signal Ava. She froze, her sharp eyes scanning the surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2586\" data-start=\"2526\">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she whispered, her voice tight with suspicion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2910\" data-start=\"2588\">Kai&rsquo;s breath hitched as the feeling intensified&mdash;someone was watching them. He didn&rsquo;t need his fragment to feel it, though he could sense the power of it reaching out, as if pulling him toward something&mdash;or someone&mdash;waiting in the dark. His heart pounded in his chest, his instincts screaming at him to prepare for an attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3031\" data-start=\"2912\">Before he could speak, a low voice drifted out from the shadows, smooth and controlled, sending a chill down his spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3060\" data-start=\"3033\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting too close.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure that emerged from the darkness was tall, draped in a black cloak that billowed like smoke in the night air. His face was obscured, but the faint glow of a fragment emanated from beneath the hood, casting an eerie light on his sharp features. His presence was like a cold gust of wind, chilling everything in its path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3676\" data-start=\"3392\">Ava&rsquo;s hand was already on her gun, but Kai held up a hand to stop her, his eyes narrowing as he studied the newcomer. This was no ordinary scavenger. There was something about him&mdash;something unsettling in the way the air around him seemed to bend, as though reality itself was warping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3886\" data-start=\"3678\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the first to come this way,&rdquo; the man continued, his voice carrying an authority that sent a ripple of unease through Kai&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t be the last. But you might be the first to survive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4255\" data-start=\"3888\">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Ava demanded, her voice steady despite the tension that thickened in the air. She was already sizing him up, preparing for a confrontation, but she wasn&rsquo;t foolish enough to rush in. Kai could see the hesitation in her eyes&mdash;the same hesitation that mirrored his own. This man wasn&rsquo;t someone they could fight without understanding what he was capable of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4467\" data-start=\"4257\">The man chuckled softly, a low sound that sent a shiver down Kai&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m someone you don&rsquo;t want to cross,&rdquo; he said, his gaze flicking toward the glowing fragment in Kai&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;But you already knew that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4873\" data-start=\"4469\">Kai&rsquo;s hand instinctively went to the fragment, the warmth of its energy pulsing against his skin. It was the only thing that separated him from the man in front of him&mdash;and from the death that seemed to lurk around every corner. But even now, with the power of the fragment at his fingertips, Kai knew it wasn&rsquo;t enough. This man wasn&rsquo;t like the others they had encountered. He was something else entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5124\" data-start=\"4875\">&ldquo;You can feel it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the man said, his eyes gleaming from beneath his hood. &ldquo;The power. The fragments are calling to you, just as they call to me. You&rsquo;re not alone in this, Kai Voss. You&rsquo;re a part of something much larger than you realize.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5251\" data-start=\"5126\">Ava stepped forward, her gun still raised, but she didn&rsquo;t fire. &ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And what do you want?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5470\" data-start=\"5253\">The man&rsquo;s smile was sharp, predatory. &ldquo;I want what you have. What we all have,&rdquo; he said, his voice soft, almost coaxing. &ldquo;The fragments. They&rsquo;re more than just power, you know. They&rsquo;re the key. The key to everything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5714\" data-start=\"5472\">Kai felt his stomach tighten at his words. He had suspected it, but hearing it aloud sent a rush of anxiety through him. They weren&rsquo;t the only ones after the fragments. Whoever this man was, he had an agenda&mdash;and it wasn&rsquo;t just about survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"5827\" data-start=\"5716\">&ldquo;Enough of this,&rdquo; Ava said, her tone hardening. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done talking. We&rsquo;ll take our chances without your help.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before she could pull the trigger, the man&rsquo;s hand shot out, and in the blink of an eye, he was standing directly in front of them. Kai didn&rsquo;t even have time to react&mdash;he could feel the energy emanating from the man&rsquo;s fragment, pulling at the very air around him, warping it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6232\" data-start=\"6104\">&ldquo;You misunderstand,&rdquo; the man said, his voice calm despite the sudden movement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to help you. I&rsquo;m here to stop you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6537\" data-start=\"6234\">In a flash, the man moved again, his hand glowing with the energy of his fragment. Kai&rsquo;s heart raced as time seemed to stretch, the world around him slowing. Without thinking, he reached for the power within himself, the familiar hum of the fragment pulsing to life as he activated&nbsp;<strong data-end=\"6536\" data-start=\"6516\">Temporal Shatter</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"6799\" data-start=\"6539\">The world around him fractured in an instant. Time slowed to a crawl, the man&rsquo;s movements suspended in mid-air. Kai could feel the strain on his body as he fought to maintain control, the power of the fragment threatening to tear him apart. He had to act fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7058\" data-start=\"6801\">With a swift motion, Kai thrust his hand toward the man, attempting to push him back, but the man&rsquo;s fragment reacted, a barrier of energy springing up in front of him, blocking the attack. The force sent Kai stumbling back, his mind reeling from the strain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7195\" data-start=\"7060\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not ready for this,&rdquo; the man said, his voice cutting through the stillness of the frozen world. &ldquo;But you will be. Soon enough.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7369\" data-start=\"7197\">Kai&rsquo;s eyes locked onto the man&rsquo;s glowing fragment, and he could feel it&mdash;a deep resonance, like two forces pulling against each other, tugging at the very fabric of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7569\" data-start=\"7371\">Suddenly, time snapped back into place, and the world lurched forward. The man was standing in front of Kai, a mere foot away, his face now visible. His eyes gleamed with a cold, calculating hunger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7743\" data-start=\"7571\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who can manipulate time,&rdquo; the man said, his smile widening. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all connected, Kai. You&rsquo;ve only just begun to understand what you&rsquo;ve unleashed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"7923\" data-start=\"7745\">Kai&rsquo;s mind raced, his thoughts tumbling over one another. The power of the fragments was a weapon&mdash;a tool to change the world. But in the wrong hands, it could destroy everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8096\" data-start=\"7925\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are,&rdquo; Kai said, his voice steady despite the storm raging inside him, &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;re looking to control the fragments, you&rsquo;ll have to go through me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8267\" data-start=\"8098\">The man&rsquo;s smile never faltered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking to control them. I&rsquo;m looking to destroy the ones who think they can. You&rsquo;re in way over your head, Kai. All of you are.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8499\" data-start=\"8269\">Without another word, the man turned and melted back into the shadows, disappearing into the night as quickly as he had arrived. Kai and Ava stood there for a long moment, the weight of his words lingering in the air between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"8699\" data-start=\"8501\">The city was quiet again, but this time, the silence was suffocating. The truth hung heavily in the air&mdash;they were not alone in this fight. And the stakes were far higher than they had ever imagined.</p>', 6, '2025-04-15 17:56:29', '2025-04-15 17:56:29'),

At the height of the Royal Academy&#39;s end-of-the-year celebration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The owner of the voice was His Royal Highness Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren. He had the Centraren Royal Family&#39;s traits, their fiery red hair and blue eyes. His body was also thin, yet muscular. Truly, his handsomeness was befitting that of a prince.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside him was a cute girl of short stature with pink hair and green eyes. She had an air around her that would make people unwittingly want to protect her. This was the baron&#39;s daughter, Amy von Brayes, who hid behind the prince with an uneasy face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if to protect her, aside from the prince, 4 other men gathered around her</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from the right, the first person was a handsome youth with dark hair and brown eyes who wore a pair of glasses and gave off an intelligent air. This was Markus von Beinz, the heir to the count and eldest son of the court magician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second was Leonardo von Jukes. A brown haired, muscular and handsome youth who had a look of strength behind his blue eyes. He was the heir to the Viscount and eldest son of the Chief of the Imperial Knights</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next was a handsome youth with long wavy golden hair and emerald green eyes who had a beautiful effeminate face that could be mistaken for a woman&#39;s. His name was Oscar von Wimlet, heir to the Marquis and Firstborn to the Richest Man in the Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, was the wild and handsome black-haired, black-eyed and brown-skinned youth, Claude Justine de Westerdale. The 3rd&nbsp;Prince of the western neighboring country, Westerdale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the one who was on the other end of the broken engagement, the ex-fianc&eacute;e, was Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. Her long hair was pale gold, reminiscent of the soft glow of the moon in the night sky and her eyes were of a beautiful ice blue. This dignified and strong-willed girl was the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. One of the three most prestigious dukes of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your Highness, I don&#39;t understand what you mean by that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm. As per usual, you are a woman with little understanding. Rather than a rotten woman like you, a kind and gentle person like Amy is much more appropriate as my fianc&eacute;e.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anastasia&#39;s eyebrows momentarily twitched. But without any change in her expression, she argued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This woman who knows nothing of Etiquette, Noble mannerisms, and feudal law is more appropriate?&nbsp; Does Your Highness truly believe this woman is an appropriate Queen for the state?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a change in her expression, Anastasia sent Amy a cold glare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meeting her gaze, Amy shrunk back with a jerk where she was softly embraced by the Prince.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&nbsp; It is exactly her kindness that the country needs. There is no place here for you to keep spinning up your foolish theories. In the first place, we know about the many bouts of harassment you&#39;ve made Amy face! A person like you is not fit to be Queen!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so His Highness the Prince denounced Anastasia with fiery rage in his eyes, joined in by the mockery of the other four youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>＊＊＊＊</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so the story I remembered went something like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Allen. I am an ordinary 8-year-old boy Living in the Centraren Kingdom&#39;s Capital, Lurden. My only family member is my mother. We&#39;re pretty poor, but somehow we still get by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what was unusual, was from the moment I sneezed a moment ago, Memories from my previous life, like me being an aerospace engineer, came flooding back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s alright. My memories have returned, but I&#39;m still Allen. I&#39;m sure about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve acted largely the same as I would have in my previous life, and so, though my previous life&#39;s memories have returned, I&#39;m feeling really confused but nothing else feels different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alright, it was kind of sudden but I know this situation is bad. Like, really bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I&#39;ll explain. This world is most likely the same one in the hit smartphone dating sim [Magical☆Fantasy～Love&#39;s Heart-Racing♡School Life].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;For now, let&#39;s not talk about the game&#39;s&hellip; unfortunate naming sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what&#39;s bad about this situation is that if things stay this way, me, my mother, and everyone in this town will die in 8 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized this because of the name of the country I live in, and the news of a certain 8-year-old Prince Karlheinz&#39; engagement with the Duke&#39;s daughter Anastasia, reminded me of something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So anyway,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oops, I may have gotten carried away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&#39;s finish talking about the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this, Anastasia who couldn&#39;t bear the one-sided mockery took of her glove and threw it at Amy, challenging her to a duel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anastasia was a girl many would consider abnormally calm and rational but all she really was, was a strong-willed girl who knew how to keep her emotions in check. But because of this course of actions, her anger overwhelmed her self-restraint and so she acted the way she did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, as Amy&#39;s fianc&eacute;e, the prince stepped up to fight as Amy&#39;s representative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, there was no one who would have wanted to fight against the Prince, and so Anastasia was made to fight for herself and lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defeated, Anastasia couldn&#39;t bear to show herself again at the academy and so she was sent off to a Provincial Convent. On the way there, her carriage was then attacked by bandits, and from then on she disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until here, it was pretty much the story of a pretty shitty ga&mdash; *cough* I mean, it was truly a lamentable development but the story didn&#39;t end there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, what was really disgusting was that those bandits were all hired by the Prince and his group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wasn&#39;t exactly explicitly said in the game, but it was definitely implied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was this event that led to an imbalance in political power which eventually spiraled down into a civil war that sent the kingdom into chaos. Taking advantage of the chaos, the neighboring Est Empire to the east declared war. With their lightning-fast march, the kingdom consumed by internal strife had no time to react, and before we knew it, the capital Lurden was already razed to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the really bad situation I was talking about. I just want to tell them straight to their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Don&#39;t drag us into your bullshit!&#39; Or something like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, my goal right now is to keep my Mom safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do that, I need to create a situation where we won&#39;t have to be invaded by the empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also can&#39;t just abandon Lurden altogether and flee south. It&#39;s not just because I&#39;m kind of attached to the town I was born and raised in but the concept of &quot;moving to another tow&quot; doesn&#39;t exist in the first place. Because in this strict hierarchal feudal system, the amount of people in the fief directly increases the influence of the local lord. So unless there was a valid reason like marriage, it was really hard to just move to another town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I could think of a couple ways to solve this problem but what I want to go with is overturning the punishment of the Villainess Anastasia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have two reasons for this. The first reason is that if this world is really going to follow the game&#39;s event progression, then I already have an idea of how to do it. And the other reason is simply wanting to save her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anastasia was the only character I really liked in the game. I don&#39;t want her to die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;Villain Anastasia&quot; is what she was called but thinking about it, she&#39;s decent in every way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have a place in society, so mind your actions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Keep your manners, whether it&#39;s during ceremonies or eating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have a fianc&eacute;e, so you can&#39;t do anything that might lead to misunderstandings, you mustn&#39;t!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You live off of the taxes of the people. Think about what this political marriage will do and do your best for the country and the people!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Prince has his. The nobles have theirs. You yourself must fulfill your own duties as well!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There might have been a few differences in words and nuances, but this was what Anastasia believed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who were told this, bullied her. Told her she was condescending and annoying. Petty and uptight. Because love and peace were the best, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But look at how things that turned out. The destruction of the royal capital, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, Anastasia was just 8 when the marriage was decided. Ever since then she&#39;s worked herself to the ground to be suited to become Queen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only did she show manners appropriate to her position as the Duke&#39;s daughter and future Queen but she was also an incredibly hard worker who never let her abilities get to her head and developed her talents in her studies, magic, arts, and even her sword skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s unfair that, after all that, this is how it would end?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, after being having her carriage attacked by the bandits Anastasia didn&#39;t die. Instead she was turned into the bandits&#39; plaything and sold to the Est Empire after being exhausted both physically and mentally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, she was given a cursed sword and became the empire&#39;s Black Knight who spearheaded the war against the Centraren Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, Amy awakens to the power of a Saint(lol) due to her compassionate heart that only desired peace. Along with the prince and the aforementioned youths, they were 6 in all. Together, they joined their powers in order to defeat the Empire and Anastasia who had fallen into darkness, as well as reclaim the lost kingdom, and finally, Tie the knot. That was the ending plot of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, Anastasia&#39;s parents who had maintained a neutral position during the civil war for political reasons, were still framed by their own family and accused of being the ringleaders of the event. Naturally, they were executed. This was another of the reasons why Anastasia fell into darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just&hellip;wow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&#39;t help but think the development team had some sort of agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So. The reason why I know this is because of my shitty sister. One time when she got dumped by her boyfriend she kept coming to my room drunk and bothering me every night. She then brought this game and forced me to complete it and unlock every single event picture. &#39;If it makes me feel better, I&#39;ll leave.&#39; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She made the excuse &#39;You&#39;re good with games right? So just do something and beat it.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#39;t just throw her out of the room. And if I didn&#39;t then she would just keep bothering me so I reluctantly did it. Well, I was pretty good at the game anyway. And at the end of the day, even if she&#39;s a shitty sister, she&#39;s still my sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what was especially painful was for a guy like me, to try so hard to increase some bastard&#39;s affection level. It just kept going on and on and on until I just felt empty and stopped thinking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah. Just thinking about it gets me mad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even though it&#39;s a dating sim, it had some absurdly difficult RTS-style battle parts. The reverse harem route felt almost impossible to complete without paying for micro transactions. Because of that, I had to say goodbye to quite a few of my precious &yen;10,000 friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah&hellip;Ugh&hellip;Let&#39;s stop thinking about it. This was something from my previous life. Let&#39;s bury it deep within my memory. No, if we could remove it altogether, that would be even better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, so to sum it up, I&#39;m going with the plan that lets me save Anastasia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my own personal choice. Of course, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m not thinking I have a chance with her. I mean she is really pretty. And I think she has a really cool personality&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s just that realistically speaking, what are the odds of a Duke&#39;s daughter getting together with a completely random townsman?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first place, I&#39;m not even part of the game. Nowhere in the game does a character like me appear. And so without even appearing in the game, I&#39;m less than even a mob character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had to say, the closest anything related to me appears in the game is when the screen shows the message &#39;After that, the townsmen of Lurden were never seen again&#39; during the &#39;Surrender of Lurden&#39; event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So. 8 years until destruction. I&#39;ll do the best I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll definitely break through this fate, save my mother, the townsmen, and Anastasia!</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 17:59:19', '2025-04-15 17:59:19'),
(37, 17, 'Chapter 2', 'chapter-2', '<p>Now that I&#39;ve decided to break through the normal scenario, there&#39;s a few things I needed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, I need to make sure that this world is really the same as the one in the game. If I can be sure of that then I can be sure that the things that will happen will largely be according to the game&#39;s scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the other goal is to find a way to make money.&nbsp; The only way to save Anastasia is to stop her from being punished, that is, to win as her representative in the duel. That means I need to enroll into the Royal Academy. For that purpose, I need money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, though I think the easiest way to solve this entire problem is to prevent them breaking up in the first place but no matter what you did in the game, the marriage was still called off so I&#39;ll chalk this option up to wishful thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, first step to accomplish those things is to get the [Scroll of Concealment]. This thing, in the game, was found in a small room in the secret passage that leads from the academy to the underground sewers of the royal capital. It&#39;s an area that had been left unused for years and was only found out during the time when the Empire&#39;s army had overrun the royal capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an item that was supposed to be discovered accidentally when Amy and the others walked through the sewers to escape from the Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we really find it there, then we can confirm that events that happened in the game can be related the current world. And with the scroll, we can move around much more freely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, whether the scroll is there or not would be a huge factor in making sure how this world and the game are related. If this scroll and a few other things could be confirmed, then we can safely assume that the world is exactly the same as in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&#39;s why I came to the Adventurer&#39;s Guild with my mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Excuse me, please let me clean out the ditches!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;O-oh! Sure kid, good luck with that! Here, let your mom fill this one out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man at the reception desk gave my mom the application form he explained the guild system while she filled it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Adventurer&#39;s Guild starts accepting registrations for kids at the age of 8 where they would help them find random chores, like cleaning ditches, that they could do around town. Actually, not too long ago, my mom encouraged me to apply but I refused, saying I didn&#39;t like the stench of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But last night when I told her I changed my mind, she was very happy. And so that leads us here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, the adventurer&#39;s system is like this: A kid like me starts off as a G-ranked adventurer. Once you become 12-years-old, you can become F rank and can advance onwards until the highest S-rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, then drop a little bit of blood on this guild card.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did as the old man said, and pricked my finger with a needle. The card flashed a bit when the blood came into contact with the card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, that completes the registration. If you lose your guild card, it&#39;ll cost you money to get another one so be careful. Also, this thing can also function as a wallet. Convenient, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was surprised at how much more convenient it was than in Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, just like that I became a G-level adventurer and continued to clean ditches every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, I was also paid 1,000 cents a day for cleaning ditches. It&#39;s the currency for the Centraren Kingdom, so it&#39;s a cent. Comparing it, I think the conversion rate is roughly around 1 cent being equal to 1 yen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>＊＊＊＊</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, after a month of hardships and stink and filth, the receptionist old man called out to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, Allen! Today onwards you can take care of the underground sewer system. It stinks is a lot worse than those ditches outside but you can get double the pay. What do you think?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, I immediately agreed. I mean, this was the reason I was doing this in the first place, you know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I accepted the request and entered the underground sewers from the stairs behind the guild and lit a lantern I borrowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t know how to get to the scroll&#39;s location from here, but I had a few ideas. I headed downstream to the underground sewers, marking my path so I don&#39;t get lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So after walking for a while, I entered a large brick-domed sewer area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s good. Now I was in the main sewers. And the red bricks around me meant that I was downstream from where the scroll was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I marked the sewer back to the guild so that I didn&#39;t get lost on the way back, and then I started walking upstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And after walking for quite some time, the walls and ceiling changed from red bricks to a gray stone structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a sign that I was getting closer and so I continued on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After around 5 minutes of walking, suddenly I arrived at a place with a picture of a bird on the wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this was exactly like the game, then there should be a hidden door in front of the place where this picture of a bird was written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I checked the walls around it and found something that looked like a button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation I tried pushing it in but maybe because it was old, it was harder than I thought. I put my whole body weight against the button until I heard something softly click into place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, with a rumbling sound, a section of the wall opened up. I had brought something like a crowbar just in case, but luckily I didn&#39;t need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went through the entrance. There should be a room with a desk a bit further in&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah. Here it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I looked inside, I saw a battered, rotten desk and a chair with its seat missing. What in the world was this room used for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I walked to the desk thinking&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please, please be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A little bit underneath the desk there was something on the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to reach out and take it but it was farther than my arms could reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damn. To think I&#39;d be held up by a trap like this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not all was lost, I had brought a crowbar-like thing just in case, and this was its time to shine. I nudged and hooked the thing and brought it towards me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the moment of truth, was this the scroll I was looking for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I unfolded the scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There I saw the symbols for &quot;Concealment&quot; written on it. Yes! This was it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, using it was easy. All you had to do was open the scroll and put your palm on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I immediately laid it flat on the ground and put my right hand on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scroll flashed brightly, and in the next moment it was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All according to plan!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment, I felt imaginary glasses light up like some sort of anime villain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt like I was on cloud 9, but it was a bit too early to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took out my guild card and checked my personal information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>─────</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Allen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rank: G</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age: 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blessings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skill: 【Concealment】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residence: Lurden</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money: 3,348</p>\r\n\r\n<p>─────</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This. Is. Great!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s perfect!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the small little basement with no one else in it. Elated cries of celebration echoed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was kind of embarrassing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I regained my composure and went back to the guild with great enthusiasm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huh? What about cleaning up the sewer? Of course, I did it on my way out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can I say? I&#39;m a man who gets the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>─────────────────────────</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〇The difference between blessings and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A blessing is like a gift sent by the gods, which gives one significant talent in a particular thing or field. For example, if you are given the blessing of【Wind Magic】, you will be given sufficient physical qualities and talents to use it, and through practice you will learn and improve at a tremendous rate. Basically, it is positioned higher than skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A skill is the state in which you are able to use some ability. When you have a skill, the way to use it will come to mind on its own. For example, if you have the【Wind Magic】skill, a type of wind magic that you can use whenever you want will automatically pop into your mind. However, unlike a blessing, you aren&#39;t granted the talent to improve it, so you can&#39;t do anything other than what is prescribed by the skill.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:00:03', '2025-04-15 18:00:03'),

Now there were two main ways you could use this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first way was so you could get in and out of places without anyone noticing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, it was an overpowered skill prepared by the game so that Amy and the others could escape from the Pursuers of the Imperial Army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without this, there&#39;s no way they could have sneaked in out of town and go to dangerous places unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing really cool thing it can do is obscure the contents of the guild card.

Time for dinner.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our house was on the fifth floor of a run-down apartment that was illegally extended. It was just a small studio room with a kitchen and a shared bathroom. I should have been immediately seen when she came in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Allen? Where are you? I can&#39;t believe him. Leaving the lamp on and suddenly going out like this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She mumbled while putting down the scrap vegetable soup, hard bread, and dry meat she bought for dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then she tried to pull on the chair I was sitting on&mdash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Huh? Was the chair always this heavy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confused, she went around the table and pulled a seat on that side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mom?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked around the area, startled. but no matter what she did she couldn&#39;t find me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I was sitting right in front of her, she still couldn&#39;t notice me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hop off the chair I was sitting on and go around to her side of the table and lightly tap on her shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, huh?

Just as long as you study properly, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. The lessons are easy to understand, though, so it&#39;s fine!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, the school I was going to was a place where you could learn how to read, write, do basic arithmetic, and learn this world&#39;s history three times per week for free. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning you could take classes for 2 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since I had memories of my past life, I didn&#39;t need to take any classes other than for subjects unique to this world like history. But I couldn&#39;t relax on my studies either because I needed to enter the Royal Academy in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, time for my next goal. This time, I needed to go out of town. There was said to be an ancient labyrinth near the outskirts of Lurden, there, I need to enter and find the『Scroll of Appraisal』.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, an eight-year-old child wasn&#39;t simply allowed to waltz in and out of town. Especially since it was out of town, there was a chance for demons to appear. We were close to the Royal Capital though, so it was highly unlikely, but other things like getting mugged by bandits and thieves could still happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where 【Concealment】comes into play. Using this, we sneak out of town, stealthily enter the ruins, and get what we want all without anyone noticing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incidentally, this 『Scroll of Appraisal』was supposed to be an item that the game&#39;s protagonist, Amy was supposed to obtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She got it by chance during her first year&#39;s summer vacation when she visited the ruins as a research project with the person you were aiming to date. So if we can find the scroll there, we can then again confirm that this world and the game&#39;s are one and the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t make light of it though, this【Appraisal】skill doesn&#39;t just appraise items. To put it simply, this thing was also really overpowered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the name suggests, this skill could be used to appraise items. That in and of itself is already really good, but where it really shined was when you paid real money for &#39;magic stones.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using those you could identify the names and skills of those weaker than you, detect treasure chests in dungeons, detect traps, find out enemy weaknesses, anticipate enemy actions in battle, and even find the correct thing to say in a conversation and the right answer to a final exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magic stones drop from defeated monsters, but in the game, there was a really limited amount of magic stones you could get so in order to show off its really overpowered features, you had to pay real money. Basically, this was the game&#39;s micro transaction system. But in this world it&#39;s an indispensable part of the plan to break through the future scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&#39;s get back on topic. So I came to the town&#39;s entrance while hiding with the 【Concealment】skill&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, no one seems to notice me. I joined a group of people heading out, but no one said anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guards don&#39;t seem to have noticed my presence either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&#39;s try entering the town again. Ordinary people use the gate I just came out of, but there were two other gates besides that. One for the merchants and one for the nobility. I went around to try and enter the merchant&#39;s gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&#39;t even going to try entering the noble&#39;s gate. If I was found out, let&#39;s not even talk about 8 years from now. I wouldn&#39;t even live to see tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I walked a bit further and reached the gate where a few merchants were lined up. They were handing some sort of paperwork to the guards and were having their cargo inspected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I walked straight through the gate. No one said anything. They didn&#39;t notice me at all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected of an overpowered skill for a hero. Excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though, after testing for a bit more, I found out that if I activated the 【Concealment】skill while someone saw me, the skill would activate, but they would still be able to recognize me. However, if I was able to escape their line of sight, the skill would then take effect and the wouldn&#39;t be able to notice me anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling better after making sure the skill worked, I left town and walked towards the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here on out, there will be demons. Let&#39;s brace ourselves.</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 18:01:03', '2025-04-15 18:01:03');

(39, 17, 'Chapter 4', 'chapter-4', '<p>Right now, after going out of the town, I was currently walking through the forest trying to find the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, from the moment you leave the town till you get to the ruins, there&#39;s a battle part. So although I know the general direction of where I need to go, I quickly found out that moving my character from an aerial view and actually navigating through the forest myself, were completely different experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This area was supposed to be the tutorial for the battle part and I cleared it by mindlessly following the game&#39;s instructions but reality was way different from the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now, it should have been around two hours of me searching the area, but I just can&#39;t find the ruins. Thankfully, 【Concealment】had been working the whole time so although I saw a few demons here and there, none of them came and attacked me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common demonic species here was a type of horned rabbit. To put it simply, it was just a rabbit with horns that was more aggressive than normal. It would have been a piece of cake for adults to deal with but I was still an 8-year-old boy so I would have been in trouble if they attacked me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though, after searching for a bit more, it was starting to get late and I still had to do work for the guild, so I thought to end the search for today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>******</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days later, I finally had an idea of where to look. By now, this was my fifth time coming here to look for the ruins, so I had more or less found out the general geography of the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I was going to go deeper into the forest than usual, and that&#39;s because I remembered a key area from the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, the ruins were located around the upper right of the map but there was also a certain tree diagonal to it at the lower left. In other words, if we can find that tree and go directly north east of it, we can find the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I continue sneaking around the forest with 【Concealment】activated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I combed the forest for around half an hour when I found it. A slight opening to the greenery and&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;There we go!&#39; Here&#39;s the tree I was looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a tall and sturdy tree that stood at the middle of the clearing, but what was interesting about it was that it had another tree snaking around it. This was what was called the &#39;strangling tree&#39; in the game. Now all I had to do was go directly northeast from here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, this forest was the home of the horned rabbits and the inside of the ruins was the home of the Blue Slimes. Neither of them were particularly strong demons, but they were more than enough to kill me if they found me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on my memory of the game, I proceeded cautiously so as not to make any noise. And after 10 minutes of walking, I arrived at the entrance to the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m sure that that was the same entrance to the ruins I saw in the game&#39;s background during the dialogue part of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was definitely it&hellip; but something unexpected was standing guard in front of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bipedal demon with green skin and a hideous face was patrolling the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of the blue slimes that were supposed to be there, there was a goblin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I walked straight towards the entrance of the ruins I walked right in front of the goblin but thankfully there were still no signs I was noticed. If it wasn&#39;t for 【Concealment】I would have been dead by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Wh-what should I do? Should I just give up and go back?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. I can&#39;t do that. Goblins were known to be a race that multiplied rapidly. There doesn&#39;t seem to be as many right now, but if I waited longer, entering the ruins would become impossible. It would become even worse when they started attacking people because then an extermination party would be sent out. Worst case scenario, someone from that party would find the scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did the setting change? No, that doesn&#39;t matter. They still couldn&#39;t see through the 【Concealment】skill and so I still had a shot at breaking in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be fine&#39; I tell myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ll believe in the overpowered skill meant for the heroine of the game</p>\r\n\r\n<p>******</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The insides of the ruins were damp, but strangely enough, the ceiling and walls were glowing faintly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I remember correctly, the game explained that this was because of a special type of glowing moss that grew in ruins and caves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew this, so I didn&#39;t bring a torch with me, but that was definitely the right decision because no matter how good the 【Concealment】skill was, even a fool would notice torchlight in a dimly lit cave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slowly crept deeper, making sure not to make a sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The『Scroll of Appraisal』was supposed to be found on the first level at the end of the corridor I was currently walking down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever I see the occasional goblin pass by, I pressed myself against the wall and held my breath. Even when they&#39;d passed, I still walked as quietly as I could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My heart was beating so hard I thought it would leap out of my chest. I was extremely nervous until I finally reached the end of the hall. There was a small room to the left and a passage to the right that led even deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation, I entered the small room to the left. The『Scroll of Appraisal』should be around the back right corner of this room, covered in dirt. But when I entered, there was a pile of random stuff piled up on the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were copper and silver coins, rusty daggers, bags containing random things, and even a stack of wooden boxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;So that&#39;s what this was!&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This must have been the room where the goblins hoarded their treasures. I tried opening a box to check inside but&mdash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Creeak*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My blood ran cold when I heard footsteps rushing towards the room. I tried to hide in the corner as fast as I could, just as a group of goblins entered the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Oh no! did they see me?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Giu giu giu.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goblin game into the room making some sort of weird, disgusting sound. It sniffed and rummaged around the room as if it were looking for something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Please don&#39;t notice me!&#39; I prayed as my heart beat wildly in my chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to calm myself and held my breath so I wouldn&#39;t make any noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goblin passed just by where I was and I was hit with a strong urge to vomit as its animalistic smell entered my nose, but I did my best to hold it in. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s really bad but it&#39;s still a lot better than the sewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>・</p>\r\n\r\n<p>・</p>\r\n\r\n<p>・</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much time had passed? It felt like an eternity, but the goblins finally left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Thank goodness.&#39; We seemed to have gotten through unscathed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I try to look around for the scroll again. I slowly open each box and checked inside but there was nothing. I couldn&#39;t find it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Where was it?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I checked inside the scattered bags, but I couldn&#39;t find anything resembling a scroll. I tried moving the boxes as quietly as I could but there still wasn&#39;t anything behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Did the setting change because I got the『Scroll of Concealment』?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, it was still too early to give up. I know the scroll was supposed to be covered in dirt, so maybe it was somewhere in the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I moved the box above where I thought the scroll should have been and checked underneath it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;There it is!&#39; Below it was something that looked like a scroll buried in the dirt. When I dusted the dirt off and checked the scroll&#39;s contents, sure enough, the symbol for &quot;Appraisal&quot; was written on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hastily tucked the scroll into my bag and turned towards the entrance. I&#39;m tempted to just run out of the room and to the entrance, but I can&#39;t do that. I need to be cautious until the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did what I did before. When goblins passed by, I hugged the wall and held my breath. My entire life was depending on【Concealment】to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay, calm down.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mustered up the courage in my heart to push down my fears and continue out of the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Was this corridor always this long?&#39; I thought creeping through, until I finally managed to escape the ruins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I checked my surroundings to make sure there weren&#39;t any goblins nearby then I retraced my steps back to town. I was about to just break into a sprint but I couldn&#39;t let my guard down. It would really suck if I was found by demons now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, it&#39;s an adventure through and through until you get back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as I thought that, the trees finally give way to open fields and the walls of the town comes into view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I can&#39;t believe I made it out alive!&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making sure I was reasonably safe, I immediately open the 『Scroll of Appraisal』and placed it on the ground and put my right hand on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a bright flash, then the scroll suddenly disappeared just like the 『Scroll of Concealment』.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I checked my status card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──────</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Allen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rank: G</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age: 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blessings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skills: [Concealment] [Appraisal]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Place of residence: Lurden</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money: 3,911</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──────</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hell yeah!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#39;t help but say that aloud. I was kind of embarrassed, but there wasn&#39;t anyone around to hear me, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m was pretty sure I was safe, but you never know, so I hurriedly went back into town. Anyway, I still had to work for the guild. I can&#39;t skip out on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was the story of how I got 【Appraisal】.</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 18:01:38', '2025-04-15 18:01:38'),
(40, 17, 'Chapter 5', 'chapter-5', '<p>It&#39;s been around two weeks since I stole the scroll from the ruins. Like usual, I came to the guild today to do some more sewer cleaning, but there was definitely more activity in the guild today compared to usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Uncle, what&#39;s going on?&quot; I asked the old man at the reception desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, why if it isn&#39;t Allen.&quot; He said &quot;Apparently they found a goblin&#39;s nest in the ruins northeast of here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh huh, it seems like they already found the goblins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You see; goblins are a species that rapidly increases in numbers. So if we left them alone, they&#39;d start to cause bigger problems, so the guild decided to form a subjugation party. And if we found the goblin&#39;s hoard, we&#39;d also make a decent profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Was that why there were no goblins in the game?&#39; Maybe in the game&#39;s scenario, the scroll was the only thing left unfound, so Amy got it many years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s still a bit too early for you to join, kid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, that place didn&#39;t concern me anymore. I was more than satisfied with getting the【Appraisal】skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which, I also hid the【Appraisal】skill since it would be really suspicious if the number of skills on an 8-year-old&#39;s guild card suddenly increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, for my next goal, I needed money. Specifically, I needed to make 15 million cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Why does he need that much money?&#39; you might ask. Well, to enlighten you, it&#39;s so I could buy another extremely broken skill called using the『Scroll of Alchemy』. This thing was completely broken, but as for explaining why&hellip; I&#39;ll leave that for another day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with,『Scroll of Alchemy』is a so-called premium item that can only be bought by paying for it, and can be bought at a suspicious store called the Lurden Store. By the way, this shop was where you bought premium items in the game. You can buy all types premium items, from the『Scroll of Alchemy』to magic stones, at this store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the『Scroll of Alchemy』was priced at an amazing 13 million cents! The price changed depending on how far you were into the game, but the highest price I paid was 15 million cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just couldn&#39;t beat the reverse harem route, so I gave up and cried rivers of blood as I said goodbye to my beloved &yen;10,000 friends to exchange for cents so I could get something more important! CG Pictures of&hellip; pretty&hellip; boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No&hellip; I&#39;m remembering it again. *hic*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, anyway, the key to my plan is this【Alchemy】skill. Using this cheat skill, I could overcome the future scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to do that, the first thing I need is money. I have to get more and more money!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing the guild chores in the morning, I changed into the best clothes I could find and went to the area where the traveling merchants set up their stalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, this district is where you came to date your favorite character, and if you raised a flag, you&#39;d get an exotic accessory or something as a gift, but today I&#39;m not looking for accessories or dates, I&#39;m looking for bargains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now I only have a little over 5,000 cents in my pocket, but I&#39;m looking for a something cheap that I can buy with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t have any magic stones yet, so it&#39;s not the completely overpowered【Appraise】skill, but it was still great to be able to figure out exactly what I saw and how much it was worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a quick look at the cheap accessory shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some accessories were selling for as little as 1,000 cents!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then my eye was caught by a pair of dirty earrings in the 2,000 cent section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>【Appraisal】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Earrings of Strength</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effect: The power of the wearer of these earrings is increased slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grade: Rare</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price: 300,000 cents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Uncle, these earrings&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh those ones? Yeah, those won&#39;t do, there&#39;s only one of them after all. You&#39;ve got to give a girl a proper one or else she&#39;ll hate you, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;O-oh. No, I&#39;m just asking about the earing&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I mean, in the first place, I&#39;m just 8 dude. What are you expecting me to do?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s what you wanted. This was sold by the wife of a merchant I used to do business with to get out of debt. Well, rather than that, tell me more about the girl you&#39;re giving these earrings to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s not what this is for, but I&#39;d like these earrings please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Huh? Okay, sure! That&#39;ll be 2,000 cents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Can I pay using the guild card?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No problem!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I touch my guild card with his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>『 You will pay 2,000 cents. Is that correct? 』</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A screen suddenly appeared in front of me, and I touched &#39;Yes&#39;. That completes the payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a really good deal out of that. I&#39;d be satisfied if I could sell this thing for even half its price. I could probably do that if I sold it to some adventurer or shop that specializes in selling to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While looking for more bargains, I came across a tattered and dirty glove for 1,000 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>【Appraisal】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Fireproof Gloves</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Description: Magical powers protect the wearer from flames. It is very hard to burn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grade: Rare</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price: 70,000 cents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Soiled, but washable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>──</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I see. So if I washed them, would the price increase?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mister, I&#39;ll take these gloves, please.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sure! Will you be using them?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I paid him 1,000 cents from my guild card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not even 30 minutes have passed, but I&#39;ve already gotten some really good stuff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a little over 2,000 cents, I went back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I got home, I washed the dirty gloves in the communal washroom. While I was there, I also did the laundry since it was still early in the day and the sun was still high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After around two hours of washing the dirty gloves and laundry, I hung them out to dry by the window. The dirt on the gloves was more stubborn than I thought so it was a pain to wash them, but with this weather they&#39;d be clean and dry by evening</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with the stubborn stains removed, the value of the fireproof gloves had risen to 100,000 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * * * *.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, after finishing school, I came to the Adventurer&#39;s Guild with the goods I bought yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Old man,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, kid. So what will it be today? More chores?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, yeah, but that&#39;s not all I came here for. I got some stuff I want to sell, could you check them out?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oho. Well, let&#39;s see them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to talk to the usual old man at the reception desk about it. This old man was actually a former adventurer who got injured and retired to become an employee of the guild. It was a bit late now, but apparently his name was Rudolph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently I had started getting attention as the only kid who kept cleaning the ditches and sewers. The other kids couldn&#39;t stand the smelly, disgusting, and difficult job so they quickly gave up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Yep. The job kinda sucks. I know how you guys felt&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&#39;s why I think the receptionist old man and the other older guild members who like me so much, since I had the guts to keep doing it, won&#39;t take advantage of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I want to sell this『Earring of Power』and 『Gloves of Fire-Protection』&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What? Where did you get such a treasure?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I bought it at the market for 3,000 cents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing this, the old man looks at me with a slightly pitying look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh. I hope it&#39;s not a fake. Let me see.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was definitely a normal reaction. Even I&#39;d feel suspicious if I heard that story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I handed him the items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And at that moment, the old man&#39;s expression changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey kid, I&#39;m going to go into the back to examine this in more detail so just wait a bit here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man ran to the back room of the counter with the items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could hear the old man and someone else talking in the back room. Every now and then, you can hear a surprised voice saying, &quot;What!?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And after a while, the old man came back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kid, if you just sell this in the streets, there&#39;s a possibility that dangerous people would come and target you. Would you mind selling it to the guild at a fair price?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sure!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then, we&#39;ll buy the earrings for 250,000 and the gloves for 60,000 for a total of 310,000 cents. They glove are in slightly bad condition. If they were good as new, you could sell them for 500,000. Sorry, about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve never seen so much money in my life before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, it would be best to agree. We could still get a lot more money in the future, so let&#39;s take a loss to day to turn a profit tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Okay, then I&#39;ll transfer the money to your guild card.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the old man processed the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Listen here, you just got lucky this time. If you get carried away, you&#39;ll get scammed or even worse, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This old man is really kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this, I cleaned the ditches for the guild and went home.</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 18:02:10', '2025-04-15 18:02:10'),
(41, 18, 'Chapter 1: Father and Son', 'chapter-1-father-and-son', '<h4>Chapter 1: Father and Son</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nanyuan City, Great Xia Prefecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment Su Yu stepped through the door into his home, he was assaulted by the aroma coming from the dishes on the dining table. Quickly tossing his school bag aside, he walked up to the dining table and picked up a piece of red braised pork before throwing it into his mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While chewing, he looked at the indistinct figure in the kitchen and said, &ldquo;Dad, maybe prepare a soup tomorrow? It&rsquo;s getting tiring eating meat every day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Stop being picky. You should be happy to have something to eat.&rdquo; Su Long&rsquo;s grumbling voice came from the kitchen, &ldquo;Also, you&rsquo;re already eighteen this year. When are you going to learn to take care of yourself? I have been taking on the roles of both father and mother for you all these years. I&rsquo;m finally going to get my freedom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still busy chewing the piece of red braised pork in his mouth, Su Yu smiled and praised, &ldquo;Dad, your culinary skills are good enough that you&rsquo;re almost a professional chef. I wish I could help in the kitchen as well, but unfortunately all the food I make is inedible!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heh,&rdquo; Su Long merely smirked at the reply. Su Yu was all talk and no action. After all, he had never even tried cooking. With a height of 1.9 meters and a sturdy physique, Su Long looked rather comical dressed in a tiny apron that did not fit the image his powerful body projected. That had always been a point of contention for Su Yu, and it was the same today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaking his head, Su Yu complained, &ldquo;Dad, can&rsquo;t you get a bigger apron? It&rsquo;s not like we can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; Su Long couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to answer the question. After placing the final dish onto the dining table, he sat down without taking off his apron. &ldquo;Eat! We must save every bit of money we can. In any case, this apron is still new&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad, you&rsquo;ve been saying that for the past three years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu rolled his eyes. Sure, it was understandable for his father to claim that the apron was new three years ago. But it was rather shameless of his father to still claim the same three years later. Su Long did not care about his son&rsquo;s remarks. He started gorging on the food on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was already used to his father&rsquo;s antics. He sat down and started eating as well. While eating, he sighed and said, &ldquo;Dad, is the battle picking up at the front line again? On my way back, I saw the military recruitment truck downstairs. They must be here recruiting in our neighborhood. I wonder who&rsquo;s going to sign up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that, Su Long stopped eating. He placed his bowl and chopsticks down before solemnly saying, &ldquo;It is everyone&rsquo;s duty to protect one&rsquo;s home and defend one&rsquo;s country. Just listen to yourself. Are you trying to say that it&rsquo;s bad to be a soldier?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; Su Yu hurriedly explained himself. His father was a retired soldier. He definitely had to watch his mouth around this topic. After all, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fun to be at the receiving end of his father&rsquo;s palm that was the size of a bear&rsquo;s paw. Su Long snorted before returning to his meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, Su Long spoke again. His tone shifted into a gloomy one as he said, &ldquo;Yu, the front line is in turmoil. The various armies have been recruiting repeatedly. New soldiers are constantly being recruited while veterans are being recalled.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was in the midst of eating when he paused and looked up at his father. His attitude changed completely as he frowned and asked, &ldquo;Dad, that has nothing to do with us, right? You have been retired for eighteen years and I&rsquo;ve just reached adulthood. Also, I&rsquo;m applying for the high academies. The recruiters won&rsquo;t come to us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It has been eighteen years&hellip;&rdquo; Su Long sighed. Yes, it had been eighteen years. &ldquo;During the past eighteen years, the Devil Subduing Army has recalled retired veterans five times. After reaching fifty years old, I won&rsquo;t be fit to be recalled any longer. During the previous four recalls, you were too young. I was worried about you so I did not answer the recalls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu&rsquo;s expression changed rapidly as he said, &ldquo;Dad, our family can be exempted from joining the army! The policy allows this!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, the policy allows this!&rdquo; Su Long grinned. He raised his head and gazed at his son before saying, &ldquo;Therefore, I&rsquo;ve not been answering the recalls. In the past eighteen years, there have been four recalls apart from the current recall! I&rsquo;ve not answered any of them! But now, my son has finally reached adulthood! He is now eighteen!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Su Yu had an ugly expression. &ldquo;What are you trying to say?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m trying to say.&rdquo; Su Long gazed at his son with a gratified and satisfied expression. He smiled and said, &ldquo;Your dad might be useless, but eighteen years ago, he was a platoon leader in command of thirty soldiers. At the time, your mom was on the verge of giving birth, so I requested for a leave of absence and returned. Who would have guessed that your mom would leave this world just like that. You were a newborn and we didn&rsquo;t have anyone else in the family to take care of you. I couldn&rsquo;t leave, so I was forced to retire from the army.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Long had a bitter smile on his face. &ldquo;When I left, not a single one of my comrades saw me off. No, it wasn&rsquo;t that they wanted me gone, but they were afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to leave after seeing them. It has been eighteen years. Not one of them has tried contacting me. They&rsquo;re all afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist returning. Even in my dreams I can see them shouting at me to return home and take care of my baby. Of my thirty brothers, nine were killed on the battlefield the first year after I left. Not one of the surviving members has left the army. Do you know what the remaining twenty-one of them are doing? They&rsquo;re all still on the battlefield right now!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tears started welling in Su Long&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I was selfish, so I didn&rsquo;t dare to ask about them. I had not responded to the previous four recalls. But this time&hellip;Yu, if your dad has to die, he would rather die a soldier on the battlefield. Your dad does not wish to die behind the front line!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu sank into silence. He was aware that his father had never forgotten the front line and the old comrades there. If his mother had not passed away during childbirth back then, his father would never have retired from the Devil Subduing Army. He had always thought that eighteen years would be enough for his father to forget and let go of the past. Today, he learned that his father had not forgotten about the past after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo; Su Yu paled as he persuaded, &ldquo;The front line is in turmoil. The number of casualties among our soldiers are only getting higher and higher. In the past eighteen years alone, the army had recalled retired veterans five times. In short, a recall was made once every three to four years. You used to be a soldier. You know very well what that means. I&rsquo;m still single. I still haven&rsquo;t entered a high academy. I still haven&rsquo;t gotten you a grandchild&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Long grinned, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for all that! What? You think I&rsquo;m going to be throwing my life away on the battlefield? No! I&rsquo;m there to win the war!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cut the crap, kid! Eat your meal!&rdquo; Su Long cut his son off. While eating, he mumbled, &ldquo;After this meal, you&rsquo;ll have to start preparing your own meals. If you can&rsquo;t cook, go eat outside. Use the money in my card. You know the password. They&rsquo;re still waiting for me downstairs. I need to make this quick. Remember to mail me a letter after passing your academy entrance exam. I&rsquo;ll be reading your letters during my free time. You&rsquo;ll be getting into a cultural research academy. Your old man is very proud of you, you know that? You&rsquo;re practically guaranteed a spot in a cultural research academy already. Your teacher told me that barring anything unexpected happening, you&rsquo;ll definitely be able to join one. A talent is finally going to emerge from our Su family! I do wonder sometimes. How exactly have you grown that brain of yours? You&rsquo;re way too smart. I used to wonder if you&rsquo;re actually my son. Fortunately, you greatly resemble my younger self in appearance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu had a pale complexion at the realization that his father was about to step into the battlefield. Nevertheless, he still couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from challenging that claim, &ldquo;Dad, are you sure I look like your younger self?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What bullshit question is that? That&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo; Su Long looked up, revealing his rough face and grinned, &ldquo;Feel free to ask our neighbor if you doubt me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was speechless. He knew that his father was trying to shift the topic, so he returned to the previous topic, &ldquo;Dad, must you go? It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m looking down on you, but it has been eighteen years since you left the battlefield. You haven&rsquo;t been cultivating much either. Even now, you&rsquo;re still at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm. Will you even be helpful on the battlefield?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who are you looking down on?&rdquo; Su Long said furiously, &ldquo;So what if I&rsquo;m only at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm? Strength is not the only thing that matters on the battlefield. Otherwise, wars would be pointless. Everything is possible on the battlefield. I&rsquo;ll have you know that I once killed an Infinite Strength Realm expert when I was only a seventh-stage Great Strength cultivator.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was still very distressed. He had no idea if that story was true, but his father had repeated the story for many years. It was highly probable that his father was telling the truth. However, he did not want his father to go to war. The front line was very chaotic. Every single year, a large number of soldiers would die there. The situation there was only getting more and more dangerous. His father was nearly fifty years old. Su Yu didn&rsquo;t even dare to imagine what it would be like for someone like that to return to the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Su Long interrupted his son. He stood up and put the dishes away before saying with a solemn expression, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve signed myself up. If I don&rsquo;t show up, I&rsquo;ll be considered a deserter. It&rsquo;s fine if I don&rsquo;t show up before signing up, but you know the consequences for not showing up now. A deserter will be executed!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad, couldn&rsquo;t you have waited for me to come back and talk about this before signing up?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just thinking about it made Su Yu furious. He knew that there was nothing he could do to change this. His father was right. It didn&rsquo;t matter before signing up. The recall order was not compulsory. All these veterans who had retired alive were people who had contributed to the army during their time on the battlefield. But upon signing up, one would be considered a soldier yet again. Not showing up after that would cause one to be labeled a deserter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is there to talk about?&rdquo; Su Long said dismissively, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t die. Even if I do end up dying, you will be eligible for a nice compensation. Don&rsquo;t forget to claim it if I end up dying. That will be enough money for you to get a wife and raise a child. See, your old man has everything planned for you!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Su Long removed the apron from his body and picked up the backpack that he had packed earlier, behaving as casually as someone leaving for a short trip. &ldquo;Do well in your exam. People like you who are supporting humanity behind the front line are just as important. Perform well in the cultural research academy and bring glory to our Su family. Cultural research academy&hellip;yes, I&rsquo;ll need to tell everyone about that after returning to the army. I have a son that has managed to enter a cultural research academy. That&rsquo;s far more incredible than their children. It&rsquo;s a pity that I won&rsquo;t be here to see your acceptance letter. Remember to snap a picture of the letter and mail it to me. I need proof or those fellows will think that I&rsquo;m merely bragging.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Su Yu stood up and ran after his departing father in panic. His father was really going to leave. He had been used to living with his father for the past eighteen years. He was not mentally prepared for this sudden departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all grown up now. Don&rsquo;t cry like a little boy.&rdquo; Su Long grinned. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re still a child, I won&rsquo;t leave. But now that you&rsquo;re an adult, I must go. When I left eighteen years ago, there were several kids as old as you currently are in the platoon. Yu, do you know? I dreamed of them. They were crying in pain in the dream, telling me to kill all those animals. I regret my decision to not send you to the Military House of Dependents back then. After all, there would still be someone looking after you while I&rsquo;m in the army if I did.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Long teared up. &ldquo;This is the fifth recall. During the previous four recalls, I had my luggage packed up every single time. But every time I laid my eyes on you, I selfishly stayed behind. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to leave. This is the fifth time! Will there be a next time for me? I&rsquo;ll probably be over fifty by then and the Devil Subduing Army will no longer accept me! It is time for me to go. The Allheaven Battlefield is waiting for me. Just you watch. I&rsquo;ll kill a few Infinite Strength Realm experts this time and keep the evidence. You won&rsquo;t be able to doubt me anymore after that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Su Long waved his hand and walked away. This was the very first time Su Yu had seen his father this carefree and heroic in his eighteen years of life. However, this wasn&rsquo;t something he wanted to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I told you to cut the crap.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing before the door, Su Yu clenched his teeth and shouted, &ldquo;If you fail to return, I&rsquo;ll become a live-in son-in-law! I&rsquo;ll change my surname and sever the inheritance of your Su family! If you really don&rsquo;t care, trust that I&rsquo;ll really dare to do so as well!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Su Long staggered and nearly turned around to unleash profanities at his son. He suddenly had the urge to stay behind and beat up his son. He knew that his son would really be capable of doing something like that. It hadn&rsquo;t been easy for the Su family to finally give birth to a talented individual like Su Yu. He definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accept such a talent marrying into someone else&rsquo;s family.</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 18:04:53', '2025-04-15 18:04:53');

(42, 18, 'Chapter 2: Four Major Academy Types', 'chapter-2-four-major-academy-types', '<h4>Chapter 2: Four Major Academy Types</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Long had left in a carefree manner, leaving Su Yu behind with an empty feeling. His father&rsquo;s departure had been too abrupt. He hadn&rsquo;t even been given any time to mentally prepare himself. He was both worried about his father&rsquo;s safety and his future life. He was already used to his father&rsquo;s care and companionship. Thus, he found it hard to get used to living alone all of a sudden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad&hellip;you left&hellip;before doing the dishes!&rdquo; Su Yu grumbled, trying to find some humor in the terrible situation he was in. Eventually, he sighed. There were things that he did not want to think about as the mere thought of those things would make him anxious. The Allheaven Battlefield was incomparably dangerous. He was worried that if he kept thinking about it, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist rushing out and dragging his father back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cultural research academy&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not in the mood to do the dishes, Su Yu plopped himself down on the couch and blanked out. His father had been nagging about his entry to a cultural research academy before leaving. Previously, Su Yu had been planning to apply for the cultural research academies. But now&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t left for the Allheaven Battlefield, I would definitely apply for a cultural research academy. But why did you insist on going to the Allheaven Battlefield? Do you expect me to not be worried about you? You might be stuck there for years. Am I supposed to keep worrying about you behind the front line? You&rsquo;re not a child anymore. Shouldn&rsquo;t you think about all that?&rdquo; Su Yu grumbled as he rubbed his temple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You left me with no choice. You&rsquo;re not home anyway. I&rsquo;ll just apply for a war academy instead!&rdquo; said Su Yu as he gnashed his teeth in anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cultural research academy was an excellent place to be. It was the place where one would study the culture of the myriad races, analyze their cultivation methods, and learn about their civilizations. Every single cultural researcher was treated like a treasure, a treasure that would be allowed to stay behind instead of heading to the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, a war academy was a place meant to serve the battlefield. Previously, he had worked hard with the goal of entering a cultural research academy so that he could safely stay behind the front line and his father&rsquo;s side. Alas, that old man of his had ended up being the one leaving for the Allheaven Battlefield instead. If he were to enter a cultural research academy, he would no longer have any opportunity to head to the front line. A war academy was different. It was rumored that their students had plenty of chances to enter the battlefield for their practical classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;War academy&hellip;Strength will be required to pass the exam.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was easy for Su Yu to think about it, but he still couldn&rsquo;t help worrying. A war academy was not a place one could enter easily. Strictly speaking, it was even harder to join than a cultural research academy. At the very least, that was the case for him. A cultural research academy had relatively low requirements in terms of strength. That wasn&rsquo;t the case for a war academy. After all, that was a place meant to supply the front line with capable warriors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source Opening, Great Strength, and Infinite Strength. Those were the early cultivation realms for the human race. Humans were born with bodies unsuitable for cultivation. Only after opening the nine acupoints would one be able to link up the meridians in one&rsquo;s body with source qi and truly became a cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nine acupoints of the Source Opening Realm consisted of mouth, nose, eyes, ears, Spirit Palace, and One Hundred Openings. The latter two were the acupoints located at one&rsquo;s head and navel. Only by opening the nine acupoints would one be able to take in source qi, refine one&rsquo;s body, strengthen one&rsquo;s bones, and shed one&rsquo;s mortal body to become a powerful warrior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just opened the three acupoints of my nose and mouth. There are still no signs of my ear acupoints opening. I&rsquo;m not even a fourth-stage Source Opening cultivator yet. It won&rsquo;t be easy for me to join a war academy,&rdquo; Su Yu muttered to himself. A war academy existed to nurture expert combatants. It was an expensive task and they wouldn&rsquo;t waste their resources on a weakling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To have a higher chance at grabbing a spot in a war academy, it would be better for Su Yu to open his ear acupoints as well and reach the fifth-stage Source Opening Realm. Of course, if he could also open his eye acupoints on top of that to reach the sixth or even the seventh stage, he would be practically guaranteed a spot there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the genius individuals who had managed to open their Spirit Palace and One Hundred Openings as well, they would have their pick at which war academy they wished to join. Those capable of opening all nine acupoints before twenty years old could join a war academy at any time. No academy would reject such an individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still at the third-stage Source Opening Realm&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu sighed. Sure, the third-stage Source Opening Realm wasn&rsquo;t too bad, but it wasn&rsquo;t that good either. The Nanyuan Secondary School, which he was a part of, had nine final year classes with a total of 750 students. Among the students, there were about a hundred students at the third-stage Source Opening Realm and about a dozen students who were at a higher stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the past acceptance rate of the various academies, less than twenty of these students would be accepted. In other words, those at the fourth-stage would have a high chance of being accepted while only one in a hundred would be accepted among those at the third-stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, not all war academies were equal. An academy that would accept third-stage students would probably be a rather weak academy as well. Rather than entering a war academy of that caliber, Su Yu might as well enter a cultural research academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Three more months&hellip;war academy&hellip;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rdquo; said Su Yu with his teeth clenched. Since his father was unreliable, he would have to be the reliable one. Just what was his father thinking when he decided to head to the Allheaven Battlefield at that age?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Huu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late at night, Su Yu was once again roused from his sleep drenched in sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that damn dream again! Dad&hellip;&rdquo; Su Yu called out by habit. In the past, his dad would quickly rush over whenever he woke up from a nightmare. But today, there was no movement outside his room after his shout. Su Yu blanked out slightly before recalling that his father had left earlier that afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sigh,&rdquo; Su Yu turned on the light and checked his communicator. It was around three in the morning. It would still take some time before the sun would rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It has been more than ten years!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody would be able to endure over ten years of continuous suffering from nightmares. It was better nowadays as Su Yu was already used to it. Back then, he had been so afraid that he refrained from sleeping and nearly killed himself from exhaustion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just why is this happening?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaning against the bedhead, Su Yu wondered. In fact, he had been asking the same question for years. He had told his father about the issue, but his father was helpless. When he went to the hospital, the doctor told him that something once frightened him so much that it left a psychological trauma on him. However, Su Yu couldn&rsquo;t remember anything like that happening before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same every single time. At the end of the dream, I&rsquo;ll be pursued by some monsters&hellip;&rdquo; Su Yu was vexed. He had been tortured by the same nightmare every single day. Or to be precise, he had been pursued by others in his dream every single day. However, that was where the similarities ended as the pursuers would always be different each time. Instead of being humans, his pursuers consisted of all sorts of monsters. Their appearances were indistinct, but from their shapes, it was clear that these were all different lifeforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just what had he done to deserve such a torture? Su Yu reckoned that he was probably the only person to have ever been pursued for more than ten years in his dreams. Back then, his father had suspected that a spell of the nightmare race was the culprit. However, this was the human realm. If it was really someone from the nightmare race, that person would have been killed by human experts long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, this was an issue that had persisted for more than ten years. If a nightmare race expert had actually gone through the trouble of sneaking into the human realm, that expert would probably be setting their sights on a human expert. Only the most idiotic person would waste so much effort over such a long period of time on an ordinary human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is there no end to this? This is so annoying!&rdquo; Su Yu complained. He wondered if this would ever end. It was a good thing he was already used to the nightmares. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to properly live his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dad said that by opening the nine acupoints and entering the Great Strength Realm, my body will be nurtured by source qi and I&rsquo;ll be immune to all sickness and evil spirits. I should be fine then, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu could only hope that the nightmares would stop after entering the Great Strength Realm. With so many thoughts in his mind, time passed quickly. Before he knew it, sunlight was shining through his window, signifying the arrival of dawn. Su Long might have left, but life went on as usual for Su Yu. It was not a public holiday today, so he still needed to attend school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After brushing his teeth and eating a simple breakfast, Su Yu grabbed his school bag and left his house. Downstairs, a young man with a crew cut hair was waiting. When the young man saw Su Yu, he hurriedly shouted, &ldquo;Yu, I heard from my father that Uncle Su&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Su Yu answered before the youngster could finish his words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crew-cut youth was getting anxious. &ldquo;What was Uncle Su thinking? He&rsquo;s a grown ass man! Going to the Allheaven Battlefield at his age is basically sui&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crew-cut youth suddenly stopped. He wanted to say that Su Long was on a suicide mission, but those weren&rsquo;t something he could say. He might believe it, but he definitely shouldn&rsquo;t be saying that in front of Su Yu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his choice. I can&rsquo;t stop him.&rdquo; Su Yu forced himself to smile. &ldquo;In any case, there are millions of soldiers at the Allheaven Battlefield with numerous human experts holding the fort there. He won&rsquo;t die so easily.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know. But Uncle Su is only a&hellip;Great Strength cultivator.&rdquo; The crew cut youth appeared even more anxious than Su Yu. &ldquo;Great Strength cultivators might be incredible for people like us, but they are the weakest of the weak at the Allheaven Battlefield. Even a fresh recruit of the myriad races at the Allheaven Battlefield would already be at the Great Strength Realm.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yu! Why are you not worried at all?&rdquo; The crew-cut youth was panicking on behalf of Su Yu. If he was placed in Su Yu&rsquo;s shoes, he would be crying already by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Would that help?&rdquo; Su Yu felt helpless. There was no changing the fact that his father had left. Worrying wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. That was definitely not something he should be doing now. This friend of his was still as impatient as ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cut the crap. Let&rsquo;s get to school first.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;School?&rdquo; The crew-cut youth was astonished. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still going to school?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu glared at the crew cut youth silently, to the point the crew cut youth was feeling uncomfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What kind of bullshit question is that? If I&rsquo;m not going to school, am I supposed to stay at home and wipe my tears every single day while waiting for bad news to come from the front line?&rdquo; Su Yu rolled his eyes. Just what was this fellow saying?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go to school. The school will send a list of applicants to the various academies in a few days. I&rsquo;ll need to sign up for that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;re signed up already?&rdquo; Chen Hao was curious. &ldquo;Have you forgotten? We signed up together last week.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that. I signed up for the cultural research academies previously. This time, I&rsquo;m signing up for the war academies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Hao was stunned. War academy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Su Yu cut Chen Hao off before he had the chance to say more. The decision had been made yesterday. The first step was to sign up for the war academies. As for actually passing the entrance examination, that would be an entirely different matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examination Registration Center, Nanyuan Secondary School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teacher in charge of registration checked her records before asking curiously, &ldquo;Su Yu, you&rsquo;re already signed up for the cultural research academies, right? Having mastered the languages of eighteen different races, you&rsquo;re one of the best students in Nanyuan. You can even get into the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy easily. Why are you signing up for the war academies?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, students signing up for both types of academies were those without the confidence to enter either. Thus, they were forced to diversify their options. Su Yu was intelligent and hardworking. Over the past few years, he had learned the languages of eighteen different races. Even the most popular cultural research academy in Great Xia, the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy, would open its doors wide for someone like him. Su Long wouldn&rsquo;t have been so confident that he asked for his son&rsquo;s acceptance letter in advance otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu did not give much explanation for his choice. He smiled and said, &ldquo;Teacher, it is always a good idea to not put all my eggs in one basket. Everyone is allowed to sign up for two types of academies, right? It won&rsquo;t hurt to be safe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But that&rsquo;s really not needed for you. All you need to do is perform well during your exam,&rdquo; said the teacher with a wide smile. &ldquo;The school had long submitted the names of top students like you. You will still need to take the entrance exam, but in truth, people like you already have your names recorded in the various high academies of Great Xia. Even if you somehow failed your first exam, they will still give you a second chance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside Su Yu, Chen Hao couldn&rsquo;t help but to enviously ask, &ldquo;Teacher, am I included in that name list as well?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teacher glanced at him and smiled, &ldquo;Yes. Your name has been recorded by the internal affairs academies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Hao&rsquo;s face fell. Internal affairs academy! The four major types of academies were war, cultural research, scientific research, and internal affairs. The internal affairs academies focused on various life skills such as automobile repair, cooking, driving, administration, entertainment, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the war academies focused on training warriors, the cultural research academies focused on studying the myriad races, and the scientific research academies focused on the research of weapons, pills, and so on. These three were decent types of academies to enroll in. The internal affairs academies were the exception among the four. For youngsters like them, that was the type of academy that they would only enter as a last resort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teacher ignored Chen Hao. After helping Su Yu with the registration, she smiled and said, &ldquo;Remember to focus on cultural research. Maybe try to learn a language or two in addition to what you already know before the entrance exam. That will be helpful for you in the future. As for cultivation, there is no rush. For cultural research academies, you&rsquo;re only required to reach the Great Strength Realm. At that point, you&rsquo;ll be strong enough to be impervious to all illness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength was not the priority of cultural research academies. The teacher was worried that Su Yu would misplace his focus, hence her advice. Su Yu nodded with a smile. After all, the teacher meant well. Nevertheless, he would be placing more effort on cultivation before the entrance examination.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:05:32', '2025-04-15 18:05:32'),
(43, 18, 'Chapter 3: Myriad Race Compendium', 'chapter-3-myriad-race-compendium', '<h4>Chapter 3: Myriad Race Compendium</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the registration center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After taking several steps forward, Su Yu suddenly turned around and asked in astonishment, &quot;Why are you still following me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Hao was confused. &quot;Aren&#39;t we going to class?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No? Where are you going then?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Hao felt wronged. Su Yu was the one who had said that he wanted to go to school earlier. Why was he changing his mind now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Library.&quot; Su Yu said indifferently, &quot;I don&rsquo;t have to attend any of the classes here anymore. The instructor gave me permission to skip my classes. As for you...are you intending to get your parents invited to the school by skipping classes?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Hao felt terrible hearing that. He ran away while covering his face. Yes, Su Yu no longer needed to attend any of the classes. The instructor had personally given him the permission for that. But that wasn&#39;t the case for Chen Hao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was exempted even from the cultivation class. He was already a third-stage Source Opening cultivator. As far as the teachers were concerned, that was enough for him. None of them saw him joining a war academy, so nobody would push him to cultivate more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the departing Chen Hao, Su Yu shook his head and laughed. Chen Hao&#39;s father was old friends with his father. Meanwhile, Chen Hao and him were classmates close enough to be considered best friends. However, Chen Hao was a raucous person, so it could be rather tiring to hang around that fellow at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Su Yu was a frequent visitor here, he was quite close with the librarian. He would frequently spend an entire day in the library. After several years of doing so, it was only understandable that the two of them were able to cultivate a close relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Su Yu, you&rsquo;ve already mastered over ten different languages. You should be taking this time to relax a bit. Why are you still studying so hard?&quot; teased the librarian. In Nanyuan Secondary School, Su Yu could be considered a small celebrity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the majority of the students, they only needed to master the divine and devil language, the demon language, and the common language. Those languages alone were taxing enough to learn that they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn more languages. Su Yu, on the other hand, had been learning even the lesser known languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu merely smiled, not saying anything. He went straight to the third floor. As the classes were still ongoing, the library was devoid of people. A few teachers were there for research, but barely any students could be found in the library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, most students would rather bitterly cultivate than spend their time studying those indecipherable handwriting. For these youngsters, there was no point using their brain for issues that could be solved with force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachers noticed Su Yu, but none bothered him. Everyone was silently immersed in their readings. Su Yu did not bother anyone in the library either. Walking a familiar path, he headed toward the bookshelf that he had frequented most. After looking over the shelf, he pulled out a massive book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ox-Faced Fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a Myriad Race Compendium. Over the years, humanity had made a compilation of the races they knew into books that served to educate the human race about the myriad races. Su Yu was holding one such book in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The so-called Myriad Race Compendium referred to a series of books instead of a single book. Su Yu had no idea how many books there were in the series. After all, access to some of the books were restricted to only a select group of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were thirty-nine of these books in Nanyuan Secondary School, detailing thirty-nine different races. The contents of these books included the appearance of these races, their habits, customs, languages, unique cultivation methods, combat preferences, hunting guide, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of these were what Su Yu wanted to learn at the moment. He was looking at the title page, the page where the illustration of the race in question could be found. Ox-faced fish sounded like some sort of fish, but that wasn&#39;t the case. Looking at the illustration, Su Yu noted that this was a race similar to an ox with the tail of a snake and a pair of wings on its back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the reason for this race to be known as the ox-faced fish, it was because this was an amphibious race capable of living both on land and underwater. In terms of combat strength, this race was stronger underwater than when on land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite having a pair of wings, this race was incapable of flight. The pair of wings functioned similarly to chicken wings that would allow them to jump higher instead of actually soaring into the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flesh of ox-faced fish, capable of expelling poison, an excellent antidote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living in the Mount Root Realm, a realm filled with mountains and bodies of water. The ox-faced fish hibernate during winter before waking up in summer. Be very cautious entering the Mount Root Realm during summer as the danger rating would increase exponentially during that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A neutral force at the Allheaven Battlefield. Do not kill without reason or explicit permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu skimmed through the contents of the book. He had read all these before, but he had not learned the ox-faced fish language. That was an extremely difficult language to learn, especially since it was such an obscure language. There was also the fact that the ox-faced fish wasn&#39;t even the dominant race of the Mount Root Realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu wasn&#39;t here to see all that. He was mainly here for the illustration of the ox-faced fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ox-faced fish...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu muttered as he recalled his nightmare the night before. Was that the monster chasing him in his dream last night? When he was younger, he wouldn&#39;t read too much into these nightmares. But as years went by and he grew older, he started analyzing the nightmares, trying to learn more about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What manner of beings were these monsters that had been chasing after him in his nightmares? Did these monsters exist in real life? Over the years, people had come to view him as a genius that was willing to put in the hard work to learn the languages of the myriad races, reaching the point of mastering eighteen languages and putting others to shame with his hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In truth, he had only been working so hard to learn about the myriad races due to his nightmares. As he spent more and more of his time researching the myriad races, he eventually started learning more languages to understand the myriad races better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The dream world is too blurry. I can&#39;t be sure if it was an ox-faced fish. But the monster in the dream last night did have a pair of wings. I think it even mooed like an ox.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu wondered to himself. As things were very blurry in the dream, he wasn&#39;t sure if the monster last night was really an ox-faced fish. However, he had managed to pinpoint several races that matched some of the monsters that had appeared in his dreams in the past. Thus, Su Yu felt that he was on the right track. The monsters in his dreams were the myriad races that existed in reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had been over ten years, over four thousand nights. He had encountered thousands of different monsters in his dreams. From the sheer variety of the monsters that had appeared in his dreams, he couldn&#39;t imagine them existing if they weren&#39;t actually the myriad races that existed in reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Myriad races, you guys sure look very highly upon me to come after me in my dreams...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu smiled bitterly. ?He was just a normal human being. Was there a point for the myriad races to invade his dreams? At that thought, Su Yu gnashed his teeth in fury. He didn&#39;t even know them! He had never even met any of them! Why would they haunt him so? Was it fun to torture an ordinary person like him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But why exactly are these dreams happening?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu couldn&#39;t understand. He could accept being tortured by these monsters in his dreams if he had actually met them. But he had never even left Nanyuan City his entire life. The only connection he had to these monsters was the fact that he had read about them in books. How would that establish a connection with these monsters?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After identifying the monster that he had seen in his dream last night, Su Yu placed the book back on the shelf. There were some things that he still couldn&#39;t investigate too deeply into for now. Shortly after, Su Yu walked away from the bookshelf. Apart from identifying the ox-faced fish, Su Yu still had some other business at the library today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short while later, he reached a different section of the library: Source Opening Section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the section housing the reading materials regarding the Source Opening Realm. For the human race, their initial cultivation method was the Source Opening Codex. Someone who had yet to open their nine acupoints and were incapable of sensing source qi. However, source qi was present everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone could take in the ambient source qi in the air and gradually open their nine acupoints before stepping into the Great Strength Realm to start their physical cultivation. Opening the nine acupoints was a lengthy process. A human cultivator would start cultivating the Source Opening Codex at a young age. Progress could only be made one step at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world of cultivation followed the law of the jungle. Geniuses would be able to rise abruptly upon starting cultivation. With a better talent in cultivation, one would naturally be able to cultivate faster. Su Yu was not completely clueless about cultivation. He was aware of all that. He knew that the Source Opening Realm wasn&#39;t a realm that could be rushed through. Progress would only happen passively. Not even hard work could accelerate the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even knowing all that, he still wanted to look around and see if he could find a way to accelerate his cultivation. Unfortunately, he wasn&#39;t able to find anything even after spending some time in the section. He frowned. Was that information not available here? If that was the case, he probably wouldn&#39;t be able to reach the fourth-stage before the entrance examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Su Yu, what are you looking for?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short-haired girl who was reading nearby couldn&#39;t hold her curiosity and asked. She had been reading in the same section for quite a while. Although the two weren&#39;t classmates, they were both frequent visitors of the library. As time went by, they naturally came to know each other. Su Yu had an apologetic look. He seemed to have disturbed her peace in the library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m trying to look for something related to increasing the speed of Source Opening cultivation but I can&#39;t find anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Increasing the speed of Source Opening cultivation?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short-haired girl muttered to herself before saying, &quot;There are several methods to accelerate the speed of Source Opening cultivation, but that is not recommended for humans. The Source Opening Realm is the foundation of cultivation. The opening of nine acupoints is a process where your foundations are built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is a realm where stability is the priority. There is a reason the first realm was named the Source Opening Realm. It is the realm where you open the source of cultivation. Su Yu, I thought you&#39;re applying for the cultural research academies? This is not something they would test you on. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually trying to accelerate your cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl was getting worried. &quot;You can&#39;t mess up your foundations. It is very dangerous. Even if you really managed to safely accelerate your cultivation, it will still negatively affect your future cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu smiled, &quot;I know. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not stupid. I only wanted to check if there is a safe method. If I can&#39;t find any, so be it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is that so...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl gave it some thought before pointing at a bookshelf at the corner. &quot;There are a few books about cultivation acceleration there. However, some of the recorded methods are too extreme. Su Yu, you better don&#39;t attempt any of those. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome. You might even die from it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;During the early years of the Anping Calendar, some humans did attempt these methods. At that time, they were left with no choice. The world was a much dangerous place back then. However, none of those seniors had managed to reach the apex of cultivation. In fact, most of them had perished at a young age due to their unstable foundations during the Source Opening Realm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Thank you. I know.&quot; Su Yu smiled and nodded. The girl was Liu Yue, a final year first class student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu did not know much about her, but she was a frequent visitor of the library like him. He had heard that she had also mastered a large number of languages. However, he was unclear as to how many languages she had actually mastered. He wasn&#39;t a busybody that would go around asking about that. She would probably be applying for the cultural research academies. That was why she did not seem to care about her cultivation level. Su Yu did not say more to Liu Yue. He went to the corner and started looking for the books Liu Yue mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source Opening Acceleration Method, My Opinions on Source Opening, Importance of Foundations...</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 18:06:05', '2025-04-15 18:06:05'),
(44, 18, 'Chapter 4: Source Opening Acceleration', 'chapter-4-source-opening-acceleration', '<h4>Chapter 4: Source Opening Acceleration</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu quickly opened the book titled Source Opening Acceleration Method. The very first page he saw rendered him speechless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This acceleration method is one that will not take survival into consideration. Take note that a majority of the people who had attempted this method had died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu smiled helplessly. That preface made it clear that this would be an unreliable method. No wonder all his teachers had exhorted him to take it slow during the Source Opening Realm. They were all trying to make sure he did not step onto a wrong path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First method: Bath in the blood of formidable divine and devil beings. These beings have their nine acupoints opened at birth. They have abundant source qi in their bodies and their blood is rich in source qi...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Result: Body explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past case: Year 9 of the Anping Calendar. The son of Great Ming&#39;s prefect had bathed in the blood of divine and devil beings to quickly open his nine acupoints, bringing him into the Great Strength Realm. He was able to open all nine acupoints within one day, but his body also exploded on the same day. He was still nine when he perished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu grimaced. Since a real case was given, this book was most likely not lying. Son of a prefect, year 9 of the Anping Calendar. That was probably the first son of the Great Ming King. Even someone like that had perished in the attempt. This was too dangerous. There was also the fact that the blood of divines and devils were not something easy to obtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The divines and devils were among the strongest races that could be found on the Alleaven Battlefield. It was said that even the weakest combatant of these two races on the Allheaven Battlefield would be at the Infinite Strength Realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The son of the Great Ming King must have obtained the leftover blood from the divines and devils the Great Ming King had killed himself. With the rarity of the blood required, this method wouldn&#39;t be feasible for Su Yu even if it worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My dad isn&#39;t the Great Ming King...&quot; Su Yu muttered to himself. If his dad was the Great Ming King, he wouldn&#39;t have bothered cultivating. Who was the Great Ming King? He was the supreme expert who had founded the Great Ming Prefecture, a pillar of humanity. His strength was at a level Su Yu couldn&#39;t find the words to describe. In short, he was so strong that this method wasn&#39;t something Su Yu should even bother entertaining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abandoning the first method, Su Yu continued reading. The more he read, the deeper his frown became.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second method: Consuming the flesh of the demons. The flesh of some demonic races are capable of opening one&#39;s acupoints once consumed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Result: Body explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past case: Early in the Anping Calendar, the human race was in decline. Human experts slaughtered some demons and returned with their corpses. A large number of humans feasted on these flesh. A majority of them died from the explosion of their bodies. A minority of them were able to quickly open all nine acupoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Only a very small number of people had successfully opened their acupoints with this method. According to the records, the flesh of the following races would be helpful for acupoint opening: golden peng race, barbaric bull race, sky tiger race...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu immediately rejected this method. What kind of a joke was this? The listed races were incredibly powerful races. They might not be as powerful as the divines and the devils, but they were still far beyond Su Yu&#39;s reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third method: Heavenly Source Fruit, a natural treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heavenly Source Fruit gathers the heavenly source qi, the original qi of the myriad realms. This fruit is extremely helpful for opening the nine acupoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locations: Can be found in the Divine Realm, Devil Realm, and Demon Realm in limited numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past case: Year 25 of the Anping Calendar. The son of Great Zhou King consumed a Heavenly Source Fruit and opened nine acupoints in the span of three days and suffered no aftereffects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu grimaced yet again. &quot;Son of Great Zhou King...That Great Zhou King only has one son, right? Isn&#39;t that the current prefect of Great Zhou, Zhou Potian?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was yet another method Su Yu had to give up on. He had never heard of this fruit before. It was definitely an incredible natural treasure. After all, Zhou Potian was still alive even now. He was also the current prefect of Great Zhou. It was clear he was incredibly powerful. But even if humanity was in possession of these Heavenly Source Fruits, it would have nothing to do with Su Yu. Something like that was basically a high-level strategic resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth method...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu continued reading, but the more he read, the more hopeless he felt. Sure enough, there were no shortcuts in Source Opening cultivation. It was no wonder that his teachers had never mentioned these shortcuts before. The available shortcuts would require either the blood of powerful divines and devils or some high-tier treasures. Most of these methods came with serious side effects as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ninth method: Look for a location rich in source qi. The source qi is distributed unevenly among the various realms. Some places are barren and some places are abundant. As one could only passively train one&#39;s acupoints during the Source Opening Realm, the speed of one&#39;s cultivation would rely on the ambient source qi of one&#39;s surroundings...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holy lands of cultivation: Allheaven Battlefield, secret grottos of the various academies, Sacred Land of the Human Realm...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu blanked out. Locations rich in source qi. In truth, those in the Source Opening Realm were incapable of sensing source qi. Despite that, he knew that Nanyuan City wasn&#39;t a place rich with source qi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m aware of this. The bigger a city is, the better the location is, and the faster one could cultivate. That is probably related to the amount of source qi in these cities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachers at Nanyuan had not mentioned that to their students because it was pointless. This was not an era where one could easily relocate to a different city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In other words, if I can get to a bigger city or a secret grotto, I&#39;ll be able to safely speed up my cultivation. But this method will still be slower compared to the other methods.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abundant source qi can only slightly increase one&#39;s cultivation speed instead of pushing one through the entire realm in one go like the other listed methods. Even so, this was still a method Su Yu hoped to utilize. Unfortunately, not a single one of the listed locations was a place he could reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could forget about the Allheaven Battlefield. As for the secret grottos, it was said that the high academies would have access to those, but he knew too little about them. There wasn&#39;t even a need to consider something like the Sacred Land of the Human Realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tenth method: Source qi liquid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of source qi liquid: natural or synthetic. Places rich in source qi are capable of producing natural source qi liquid. However, natural source qi liquid is extremely rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for synthetic source qi liquid, it is something produced by Skysoar Realm experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source qi liquid has the same level of efficacy as a location with abundant source qi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no way Su Yu would be able to get any natural source qi liquid. As for synthetic source qi...a Skysoar Realm expert was required. Su Yu smiled helplessly. Skysoar Realm? One would still be cultivating one&#39;s physical body at the Great Strength and Infinite Strength Realms. But beyond that, a human cultivator would be able to take to the skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Skysoar Realm was a stage where human cultivators would go through a qualitative transformation. Was there even a single Skysoar Realm cultivator in the entirety of Nanyuan City? Perhaps. Maybe the mayor was one such expert. But could Su Yu realistically get in contact with an individual of this level?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the Nanyuan Secondary School, the strongest individual was the principal. But even the principal was only at the Infinite Strength Realm. If an Infinite Strength cultivator could actually produce source qi liquid, the principal was probably nice enough that Su Yu could get a few drops off him. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t rely on anyone!&quot; Su Yu complained. No wonder these books were left collecting dust at the corner of the library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For people like Su Yu, none of the listed methods were usable. The easiest method would either be finding a location with rich source qi or getting some source qi liquid. However, source qi liquid would require a Skysoar Realm expert at the very least. That was out of Su Yu&#39;s reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His father was a seventh-stage Great Strength cultivator eighteen years ago. Due to the lack of ambient source qi in Nanyuan City and the lack of support after leaving the army, his father had only managed to reach the ninth-stage after all these years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even at such a low cultivation level, he was still regarded as an important individual in Nanyuan City. Of course, his father did not think that he was anyone special. After his retirement from the army, he had worked as the city&rsquo;s traffic controller and lived a relatively leisurely life. If he hadn&#39;t sacrificed his career prospects to raise Su Yu, his cultivation of ninth-stage Great Strength Realm would be enough to get him a rather respectable position in Nanyuan City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;None of these methods works!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Su Yu gave up and returned the books to the shelf. After giving it some thought, he approached Liu Yue apologetically and said, &quot;Liu Yue, can I get a minute of your time?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue placed down the book she was reading and smiled, &quot;Of course.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t been paying much attention to cultivation all these years. Do you know about source qi liquid?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You want to buy some source qi liquid?&quot; Liu Yue immediately understood what Su Yu wanted. After all, as the one who had referred those books to Su Yu, she had naturally read them as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Source qi liquid...that is a strategic resource. It is not available for purchase in Nanyuan City. However, you can find it at the capital. You need to register your real name before making the purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are many types of source qi liquid. The liquid formed by experts of different cultivation levels would be different as well. Naturally, for Source Opening cultivators, the liquid formed by Skysoar cultivators would be the best. That would be the cheapest tier of liquid you can get. With the relatively lower density of qi in the liquid, it is much easier for Source Opening cultivators to digest. If the density is too high, Source Opening cultivators can easily harm themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;However, it definitely wouldn&#39;t be cheap to purchase. After all, even a Skysoar cultivator would require three days to form a drop. However, Skysoar cultivators need their source qi for their own cultivation as well. Unless they are broke, no Skysoar Realm expert would be willing to form any source qi liquid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue gazed at Su Yu and said, &quot;Su Yu, it really isn&#39;t worth it. Source qi liquid can only increase your source qi density. It won&#39;t guarantee an opening of your acupoints.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know. Thank you. So how much for a drop of source qi liquid formed by a Skysoar expert?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu naturally knew that it wouldn&#39;t be cheap. But he still wanted to learn more. After all, his father had left a decent amount of money behind before leaving. Or to be precise, Su Long had left all his money behind. After all, the Allheaven Battlefield was a dangerous place. There was no guarantee that he would be able to return with his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;100,000 anyuan dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu grimaced. 100,000 per drop? His father was a ninth-stage Great Strength cultivator. Working as the city&#39;s traffic controller, he had a monthly salary of 5,000 anyuan dollars. That was by no means a low salary. After deducting the money used for their family&#39;s daily expenses and some cultivation resources, they could save about 20,000 or 30,000 anyuan dollars per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through years of saving, Su Long had saved about 300,000 anyuan dollars, enough for his son to start a family. But now...it turned out that all their family savings only amounted to three drops of source qi liquid? No wonder Liu Yue said that it wasn&#39;t worth it! Using source qi liquid to cultivate was basically the same as burning his money away!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing Su Yu&#39;s expression, Liu Yue couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &quot;I told you. It&#39;s expensive and totally not worth it. In truth, I had used a drop before. It only increased my source qi density for about three days. It&#39;s really not that good. I only used it that one time. It&#39;s too expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it&#39;s really that good, the school would have long encouraged us to use it. After all, the school could still afford that much money for something actually useful. Just look around you. How many people do you know that have actually used this method?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you couldn&#39;t open your acupoints within three days, you will then have to buy more. In six days, 200,000 dollars would be used. In nine days, 300,000 dollars would be wasted. Nobody can sustain that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu smiled helplessly, &quot;I understand. It&#39;s really too expensive. If it guarantees the opening of my acupoints, it might still be worth a try. But if I fail to open any acupoints, I would have wasted my money for nothing. No wonder all the teachers claimed that there are no shortcuts in Source Opening cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s the truth,&quot; Liu Yue smiled. &quot;You&#39;re not going to be taking any tests related to your cultivation anyway. Why are you suddenly thinking about buying source qi liquid?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I signed up for the war academies. Not putting all eggs in one basket and all that, you know?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu gave a short explanation before taking his leave with a smile on his face. This was the library, not a place for them to chat away. Looking at the departing Su Yu, Liu Yue raised her brow curiously. Signed up for the war academies? Why would he sign up for the war academies for no reason?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She shook her head and stopped thinking about it. Nothing would change even if this fellow had signed up for the war academies. They would most likely still end up schoolmates in the same cultural research academy. She could only hope that this fellow wouldn&#39;t do anything stupid.</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 18:06:40', '2025-04-15 18:06:40');

(45, 18, 'Chapter 5: Dreamland', 'chapter-5-dreamland', '<p>Although Su Yu had not managed to find a suitable cultivation acceleration method in the library, he wasn&#39;t too disappointed. If such methods could really be found so easily, the school wouldn&#39;t have kept it out of the curriculum. He was merely trying his luck. Since he couldn&#39;t find anything, he could only continue bitterly cultivating the Source Opening Codex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu grabbed his lunch at school and returned home late in the afternoon. Looking at his empty house, he sank into silence. The house felt so lonely without his father around. In the past, his father would have dinner ready for him by the time he was back from school. He wasn&#39;t used to returning to an empty and silent home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not in the mood to make dinner, Su Yu sat down on the couch and turned on the television. With the television providing the background noise, he started blanking out. This was an era where there were not many television channels in existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Great Xia, only the Great Xia TV Station and several local stations were available. Due to the effect of the Allheaven Battlefield, the television signals in the Human Realm were limited in coverage. Thus, the people of the different prefectures would generally only be able to gain access to their local stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Recently, traces of the Myriad Race Cult have been discovered in Great Xia. All citizens of Great Xia, please remember to notify your local Windcatcher Department if you encounter any suspicious individuals...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those bastards!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu couldn&#39;t help but to curse upon hearing the news from the television. Those people were a bunch of bastards. A war was raging between the myriad races. Although the human race was able to resist the other races, humanity was not considered a powerful race among all the races in existence. As a result, some humans had decided to offer their allegiances to the other races instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Myriad Race Cult was not a single cult. Rather, it was a general term used to label the various organizations of humans who had betrayed humanity. Together, these traitors sowed chaos in the Human Realm. Influenced by his father since he was young, Su Yu loathed these traitors of humanity. Looking up at the television, he saw that a square face had appeared on the screen. The face belonged to a middle-aged man clad in red with a heroic appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a cold expression, the middle-aged man commanded, &quot;Kill!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plop!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, over a hundred kneeling individuals appeared on the screen. Standing behind the kneeling individuals were some armored soldiers. As they swung their blades down, over a hundred heads dropped to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All members of the Myriad Race Cult will be killed without mercy,&quot; declared the middle-aged man coldly. He looked straight ahead, as though his gaze could penetrate the television screen itself. &quot;Only death awaits you who have decided to enter my Great Xia. From today onwards, the Martial Dragon Guards will start patrolling the Great Xia. Bastards of Myriad Race Cult, feel free to stay if you&#39;re not afraid of death. Let&#39;s see how many heads you have to offer us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting on the couch, Su Yu grew excited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xia Longwu! The prefect of Great Xia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the public execution, he did not mind it. Everyone was already used to such sights. In fact, this was not the first time something like this was shown on the television. The human race would treat all captured Myriad Race Cult members the same: execution upon capture. This was an iron-blooded policy aimed at discouraging traitors from appearing through fear. These public executions were meant to serve as a tool to warn everyone to not even think of betraying humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu did not care about the executions. Instead, most of his attention was on Xia Longwu. This prefect of Great Xia had a forceful personality and a formidable strength. Twenty years ago, he was the commander in charge of the Devil Subduing Army on the Allheaven Battlefield. That was the same army Su Yu&#39;s father had served in. Thus, Xia Longwu could be considered as his father&#39;s ex superior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Su Long would become incomparably excited every time he saw Xia Longwu on the television. He would excitedly drag Su Yu over and pointed at the television while saying, &quot;That&#39;s your old man&#39;s ex superior. Back then, he dominated the Allheaven Battlefield and looked at all our enemies with disdain. He slaughtered so many enemies that the opposing armies would frantically flee while tossing their armors and helmets away whenever they encountered us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time went by, even Su Yu developed a sense of worship toward this super expert who had dominated the Allheaven Battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be great if I can be as strong as the prefect,&quot; muttered Su Yu longingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a true expert. In fact, no reigning prefect was a weakling. However, it was worth noting that even among all the prefects, Xia Longwu was still one of the stronger ones. Even more impressive was the fact that Xia Longwu was only about 60 years old and could be considered young for top cultivators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other prefects were much older. For example, Zhou Potian of Great Zhou was someone who had lived since the early years of the Anping Calendar. He was over three hundred years old today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty years ago, Xia Longwu was only over forty years old. At such a young age, he had gained enough strength to lead the Devil Subduing Army. That was what Su Yu was envious of. That was too strong! In this era, forty years old was an extremely young age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What manner of strength would one need to become the leader of the Devil Subduing Army? Su Yu had no idea. He only knew that one needed to be extremely powerful to do so. That wasn&#39;t a feat Xia Longwu had accomplished simply because his grandfather was the legendary Great Xia King who had founded the Great Xia. After all, there were still other living children of prefecture founders around but none had reached the same height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Xia Longwu! Martial Dragon War Academy! Martial Dragon Guards!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu licked his lips in excitement. He was, after all, still a youngster. Someone like him would naturally be hot-blooded. Had he ever considered joining a war academy in the past? Of course he had!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were many war academies in Great Xia. Among them, the Great Xia War Academy was one that had existed for over three hundred years. It was the oldest and the most prestigious war academy in Great Xia. However, there was another top-tier war academy in Great Xia. It was the Martial Dragon War Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was an academy named after Xia Longwu himself, as the Longwu in his name meant martial dragon. It had only been established for fifteen years. In such a short period of time, it had managed to establish itself as one of the best war academies in Great Xia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A majority of their graduates would end up joining the strongest army in Great Xia: the Martial Dragon Guards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was said that even Nanyuan City&#39;s mayor had come from the Martial Dragon Guards. From that, one could see just how impressive that army was. Su Yu&#39;s father was a soldier from the Devil Subduing Army. Back then when he first retired, he had tried joining the Martial Dragon Guards to continue serving under his ex superior. Unfortunately, he was rejected by Martial Dragon Guards. He was too old and too weak for such an elite army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, Su Long was extremely furious to be rejected, to the point he unleashed a string of profanities at the point of rejection. Naturally, the target of his profanities was not Xia Longwu. Rather, it was the recruiter. Why would they reject him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was rumored that a team of Martial Dragon Guards was stationed at Nanyuan City, but Su Yu had no idea if that was true. He had never seen those guys in the city before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Great Xia War Academy, Martial Dragon War Academy...the Great Xia War Academy mainly focused on producing soldiers to serve the front line. Their graduates will not have much chance to return home after graduation. As for the Martial Dragon War Academy...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu&#39;s eyes lit up. The Martial Dragon War Academy was different. That was because their students were considered the reserve force of the Martial Dragon Guards. Of course, the students of Martial Dragon War Academy would also be sent to the front line like those from the other war academies. However, the Martial Dragon Guards&#39; main task was to protect their homeland. In other words, they could remain in Great Xia most of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the moment a major conflict broke out, the elite Martial Dragon Guards would also be the first to be deployed to the Allheaven Battlefield. If the Devil Subduing Army was considered a standing army, the Martial Dragon Guards could be considered a field army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They have fewer limitations and more freedom. In exchange, they will be conducting the most dangerous missions in battles. If I wish to enter a war academy, the Martial Dragon War Academy would be a good choice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the Martial Dragon War Academy was much harder to join than the other war academies. Due to its nature as the reserve force for the Martial Dragon Guards, they were far stricter in recruitment. Rubbing his face, Su Yu smiled helplessly. Joining the Martial Dragon Guards would only be a dream for him. It would be difficult for him to join even a regular war academy, much less the Martial Dragon War Academy. What was the point of thinking all that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is the Myriad Race Cult courting death? Why would they enter Great Xia? Even the Martial Dragon Guards have been deployed. I wonder if I can see them here at Nanyuan...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu wasn&#39;t too worried about the Myriad Race Cult. Those people were all akin to rats that could only scurry about in the dark. They would only dare to scheme about while in hiding. With the Martial Dragon Guards deployed, these people would probably go even deeper into hiding. How would they still dare to show themselves? Even if they did show up, Su Yu had nothing to fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was an era where almost the entirety of the Human Realm had been militarized. There might not be any Infinite Strength Realm experts in the neighborhood, but they still have some Great Strength Realm experts around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His father was a veteran that had rejoined the army, but there were still several veterans in the neighborhood that had not returned to the army. If the Myriad Race Cult really decided to send several Great Strength cultivators over, it would be no different than suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those old veterans were all retired from the battlefield. Each and every one of them was someone whose hands were drenched in blood. They wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kill. A single shout in the neighborhood would be enough to instantly summon about seven or eight of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Done with watching the television, Su Yu had a simple meal of instant noodles before washing up and practicing the Source Opening Codex. That night, he went to bed early. After all, his sleep would be disturbed by nightmares. The only way for him to get enough rest was to actually get more rest. Su Yu had determined that his nightmares would generally start around midnight. Prior to that, his sleep would be relatively peaceful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dreamland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A scene that had repeated itself countless times was once again reappearing. A massive flying monster was chasing after Su Yu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fuck!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was nothing Su Yu hated more than the flying monsters. They were too fast for him to escape from. He had encountered land-based monsters before, and things were definitely better during those encounters. After all, he would be able to escape the fate of being caught and eaten every now and then when facing those monsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, he had never escaped from the flying monsters once. Every single time, he would be caught and eaten before waking up from the torturous nightmare. He hated these flying bastards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This nightmare was no exception to the norm. The massive flying monster was very fast. The complicated terrain of the dreamland posed no challenge for the monster. Slowly, it got closer and closer to Su Yu. While running, he did not forget to look back at the monster. He wanted to see if it was one he recognized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a lot of different flying races in existence and Su Yu only knew about a dozen of them. This time, the monster chasing after him actually looked familiar. The monster&#39;s appearance was blurry, but he could vaguely see a wart on the monster&#39;s massive head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is...an iron-winged bird! Holy shit! After so many years, I finally met a monster I know!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu grew excited. He knew eighteen different languages, but that did not mean that he had actually met the races whose languages he had learned even after including all the monsters he had encountered in his dreams. He only had a vague idea of what these races looked like and had only learned their languages because there were some other people in Nanyuan Secondary School who knew these languages as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had never encountered an iron-winged bird before but he knew its language! This was one of the eighteen languages he had mastered, and he was not the only person in his school that knew the language. After all, the iron-winged bird race was commonly utilized by the various powerful races on the Allheaven Battlefield as the air force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu hurriedly looked back and shouted, &quot;Weiyi xijiu yun(Why are you chasing me)?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gigantic bird did not reply and continued chasing him like it hadn&#39;t heard anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Luyi jiyou(We&#39;re friends)!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still no response. Su Yu cursed inwardly. Looking at the descending claws of the monster, he knew that he was going to die yet again. It was very likely that this was an iron-winged bird. However, it did not seem to be sentient. After all, this was only something conjured in his dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crack!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, intense pain erupted on Su Yu&#39;s head as it was crushed by the bird. Slowly, the dreamland dissipated around him. He knew that he was on the verge of waking up due to the pain he was feeling. Right that moment, the massive bird suddenly shouted with a shrill voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Moonlight!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was stunned. Next, he woke up drenched in sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Moonlight...no, in its tongue, it means blood!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu&#39;s eyes widened. He heard what the bird said! Although the iron-winged bird had managed to kill him, it seemed furious, as though it had failed to obtain what it wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Blood! It was chasing after me for my blood!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bird had spoken using the iron-winged bird language, so Su Yu was able to understand it. In the past, the monsters had spoken to him as well, but he couldn&rsquo;t understand any of the words spoken to him since those weren&#39;t the languages he had learned. That wasn&#39;t the case this time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Blood. Blood is their goal? What does that mean? Do they want my blood? But I would bleed in the dream whenever I was injured. That had never changed anything. What is the meaning of that exactly?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu was still in discomfort from his recent nightmare, but he ignored it and sank into deep thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It wanted blood, but it couldn&#39;t get my blood from my dreams. Or maybe my blood isn&#39;t the point here? Perhaps...I need the blood of its race?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The blood of an iron-winged bird? What will happen if I can get some? A dream is a dream. Even if I can get my hands on some, can I even bring it into the dream?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu rubbed his temple with his sweaty hand. Now wasn&#39;t the time to be bothered about his sweat. Something seemed to be clearing up about his dreams. This was the very first time in so many years that he had come so close to learning something new about his dreams. His efforts in learning the many different languages had finally paid off. Even if he had only gotten a single word from his dream, it was still worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t stop here. I need to try something. What will happen if I can get some iron-winged bird blood? But I&#39;ll encounter a different monster tomorrow. Will the iron-winged bird blood still work tomorrow? Screw it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Yu sat up on the bed as he reached a decision to do something about what he had learned. He was sick of being killed repeatedly in his dreams. He needed to solve this issue as soon as possible. It felt really terrible being killed in his dreams every single day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll go to the Xia Trade Company when the sun rises. They have all sorts of things for sale there. They might even have some iron-winged bird blood in stock. After all, the iron-winged bird is rather common on the Allheaven Battlefield. I might be able to buy some there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having made his choice, Su Yu was no longer in the mood to continue sleeping. He waited in excitement for the sun to rise. Even if this clue only had a tiny chance of deciphering his dreams, he would still be willing to try it. He was sick of being tortured every time he went to bed.</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 18:07:14', '2025-04-15 18:07:14'),
(46, 19, 'Chapter 1 - A Boring Life', 'chapter-1-a-boring-life', '<p>Li ended each of his meaningless days by reclining in his chair and meditating by thinking of nothing. He pushed his whole back on the chair, and its velvety cushioning supported him, soothing his muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An in-built massage system in the chair sensed his weight and scanned his body, determining which muscles were tightest and in need of most relief. A compress patch on his knee applied pain relief for a nasty wound he had suffered in combat many years ago. A stray bullet had shoved itself right in his kneecap. A supposedly banned bullet - the type that left nasty bits of self-replicating shrapnel festering in the wound - but nobody ever listened to rules when war really came around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothingness came to Li in gradual waves. He imagined it was like the seaside waves he had seen in history videos where impossibly blue waves flowed gradually towards shore, covering it bit by bit until finally, there was just water, settled and gentle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li sighed as the pain in his knee faded and the tightness in his muscles dispersed. Nothingness came to him easier now. Thinking of nothing made him calm, and calm was something this world sorely needed, something he needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2100 had just started a month ago, and at first, people were hopeful. The start of a new century. Maybe there would be change. Fewer proxy wars between superpowers in the East and West. Fewer natural disasters from a climate and planet that teetered at the brink of destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, none of that happened. The world was still in the same chaos it had been in for the past fifty years. The sun still never shone, covered as it was under thick smog that was black as tar and reached deep into the lungs like poisonous tendrils, spreading a rattling cough among all those too poor to afford a proper mask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li, though, was fine. As far as material need went, he didn&#39;t want for anything. Working as a gene engineer for Sino Biocultures, the largest company in China for genetically modified crops, his salary was nothing to scoff at. It let him dive deep into the materialistic, consumerist culture of the world, letting him buy a large apartment in the richest complexes where electrified, sentry-guarded gates warded off the poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But material wants never satisfied Li. His parents had been in the last generation to grow up in the green age, when the birds still sang and the forests were still tall. They had been farmers who had moved to the cities for better jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In coming to the cities penniless but filled with drive for a better future for themselves, they sacrificed their time and health toiling away as delivery drivers, cashiers, and whatever odd job they could scrap up. But what they didn&#39;t sacrifice were their memories of a world far quieter, bluer, and greener than the sooty dim of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they had Li, they had gifted him these memories. He grew up with stories of great and green forests where his father had played. Streams gurgling and blue that were clear like crystal and fresher than any bottled and treated water. Flowers of all colors that bloomed across rolling hillsides. Little animals that scurried across the ground and chatty birds that streaked through skies blue and filled with the warmth and light of a golden-yellow sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li had fallen in love with these stories and when he was little, had said he wanted to be a farmer just like his parents once were. A ridiculous dream. His parents had laughed at him just as they would if he had said he wanted to rule the world: both dreams were equally impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They told him how nobody worked the fields anymore, that big, loud machines had cleared down the forests. The birds had choked on the smog. That the oceans were empty and bustling with great barges of plastic as large as islands. The only crops were now grown in labs, engineered to perfection to withstand the burdens that man had placed upon them in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Li grew up, he fell in line with the rest of the world but never truly gave up his childish dreams. He studied hard and well and excelled, getting into a top university. There, he studied plant science and horticulture, thinking that maybe, just maybe, he could innovate a way to bring back those green forests and those colorful flowers he had always heard of but never seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granted, he did avidly watch and research them through videos that detailed the past, but he would ultimately never see them with his own two eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But reality was a harsh teacher. After graduating, Li had been drafted into a war. He fought for two years before an injury sent him out of commission. Then his parents&#39; health began failing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They had started coughing - the city smog had caught up to them. He went back to university and changed his studies to something more profitable &ndash; gene engineering. He gained a job at Sino Biocultures and provided for his parents until they passed - that was the most he could do for the people who had raised him and sacrificed so much for him, but almost everyday, he wished he could have done more for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, Li had nothing he truly valued. He had money and prestige and all the benefits that came with it. An expensive car, tailored clothes, nice home, and more women than he could count, but none of it had any value, any substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could never make his dreams come true. The dreams his parents had grown within him, dreams of a world bygone with technology&#39;s cold progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could never hold a rabbit in his hands or watch a flower grow from seed to bloom. He could never walk by groves of trees towering and full of green, bushy leaves. He could never swim in oceans vast and blue, teeming with fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps because he recognized how little power he truly had to change the world, he lashed out against it. He began to hate the mega corporations and their unending greed that had blotted out the skies and choked out the forests. He began to despise all those people that had sacrificed the beautiful world around them just for a little bit of convenience. He ended up with no friends, only acquaintances, and he felt himself an empty soul in an empty shell, working every day to live and yet never truly living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because no matter what he felt, no matter how hard he worked, he could still never change the world, and so, he had no choice but to give up, to fall into place as another cog in the system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li turned to virtual reality. Elden World, the top VRMMORPG of the video game industry, let him sink his teeth into a world that was not his, where he could make the impossible possible. Where the grasses were still green and the skies still blue. He threw all his free time, money, and passion into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li pushed his rolling massage chair up to his desk. He reached forwards and put on his VR headset. The sleek design of the visor nestled snugly around his head. He heard a click as the headset synced its electrical signals with his nervous system, allowing him to truly experience an entirely different reality through not just sight and sound but also smell, taste, and feeling. He gave a mental command for his computer to boot up and start Elden World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was when he felt most alive.</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 18:14:07', '2025-04-15 18:14:07'),
(47, 19, 'Chapter 2 - Elden World', 'chapter-2-elden-world', '<p>Li opened his eyes to a whole different reality - Elden World. He stood in the midst of a wondrous garden that would never have been possible in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flowers and ferns and vines and herbs of all kinds and colors and shapes dotted the garden, organized into neat little square patches walled with gold-engraved marble. Rustic, worn and beaten dirt paths ran around and joined each patch, forming into a neat grid that connected every grove to the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gurgling from flowing water echoed through the air. The water trickled from fountains placed in the center of each garden grove, their forms carved from snow white alabaster and shaped into the maws of wondrous beasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here was Li&#39;s greatest work. His time and passion manifested. His blood, sweat, and tears over five years crystallized. His guild &ndash; the Arboretum. He was currently located in the Inner Sanctum, the most important and central location of the guild. It was meeting place for the guild&#39;s executives, the treasury, and Li&#39;s garden all in one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, he had gathered the rarest types of plants in Elden World and planted them here. These were plants that could be fashioned into the highest tier of crafting materials and certain coveted Celestial-class items required these unique materials to create. Many of these plants were also the only ones of their kind, won from one-time events or auctions that Li had paid no small price to obtain in both effort and money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li looked to the horizon. Tall trees rose up almost like gate walls. They were twisted and gnarly with the faces of what seemed to be agonized humans etched into their bark. Beyond them was an entire forest of these haunting trees - the Medial Sanctum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arboretum&#39;s structure was that of a concentric circle with three layers. The Inner Sanctum where Li currently stood was the smallest and innermost circle. The Medial was the forest surrounding it, full of wild beasts acting as guards. Then there was the Outer Sanctum, a great big moat teeming with fish both deadly and harmless, outlining the forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mostly cosmetic choices, really. Guilds couldn&#39;t be invaded unless in agreed upon guild wars, but the idea of having some kind of indestructible fortress was still appealing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as guilds went, though, Arboretum didn&#39;t rank highly. Li, though a competent combatant, wasn&#39;t even the highest ranked player in the guild. That title belonged to Oceanmaster or perhaps //BEAST//, creators and maintainers of the Outer and Medial sanctums respectively and two of Li&#39;s closest friends and executive members of the guild&#39;s board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there was no argument as to who the most important player was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arboretum was one of the wealthiest guilds around despite not having any tournament record. That was almost solely because of Li&#39;s gargantuan efforts. By stockpiling and gathering all these rare, one-of-a-kind herbs and materials over hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars, he guaranteed that the guild had sole control over their supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farming them was easy. Place them in a garden, let time pass, and voila &ndash; copies of them emerged. But Arboretum tightly controlled who got these materials, jacking up their prices and preventing seeds from ever getting out, only ever selling crafting materials that could never be planted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, most of the guild&#39;s other membership was that of crafters and blacksmiths, not warriors and mages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li looked down at his hands, the very hands that had built this place up from the dirt. They were dark branches wreathed with moldy vines and dotted with curved thorns. His three fingers were long, spindly branches that ended in giant claws of splintery wood. He was an Elder Leshen, one of the highest forms of the treant race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li had chosen the race because of their lore, mainly. Treants were defenders of the green. They felt the flow of life and death deeply and cherished the sacredness of nature. They were the embodiment of the forest and earth and served as a reminder of untamed wilds that had long since been demolished in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though perhaps not an incredibly efficient race for combat, Li&#39;s passion for nature overtook any regrets he might have had in not being as good at PvP or PvE as others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it was passion that separated him from the average player. Many players here came for just fun and games. But for Li, this was quite literally his dream. A second life. A world where he could see the greens and blues he had always wished for and truly grow something from soil that wasn&#39;t barren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, in the end, he knew even this was fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Li could see the beautifully vibrant world around him, there were still imperfections. Grainy pixellations where rendering wasn&#39;t complete. Colors, that though they were bright and beautiful, weren&#39;t quite real. Though he could smell the fragrant flowers and touch their soft petals, the sensations were faint &ndash; strong sensory stimuli was banned from commercial VR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li sighed, the leaves on his shoulders rustling. He couldn&#39;t think about what he didn&#39;t have so much. Instead, he focused on what he always did. Keeping inventory of his current plants and planting more. He carried around a pouch full of rare seeds - quite possibly one of the most expensive items in the entire Elden World community - while scrutinizing a sticky note brought up on his interface that detailed the location and contents of every square patch of dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work was soothing. There was a certain harmony and monotony to the simplicity of just walking around, making sure things were in order, and planting life where it was needed. It was a massive contrast compared to the complicated tumble of his work life and the dizzying buzz of keeping up with the chaos of current events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It gave him peace and he felt that this was the closest thing he would ever get to to farming, to living the life his father had tilling the soils with callused, dirt-creased hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few minutes, Li something jolted him from his routine. Behind one of the garden patches was what he identified as a glitched spot. There was a small patch of complete darkness where nothing was rendered. Sometimes these patches appeared and generally they didn&#39;t affect the game, but they were annoying to deal with because they could block important visual cues for enemy spells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li thought about reporting the glitched area to moderators but decided against it. He was feeling a little curious today. Without thinking much of it, he stepped into the void, not knowing that he would never step back out.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:14:35', '2025-04-15 18:14:35');

(48, 19, 'Chapter 3 - New World', 'chapter-3-new-world', '<p>Floating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was what Li felt as his consciousness drifted through what felt like nothingness. Around him was darkness. A murky darkness that seemed to have substance, shimmering almost like waves of black water. But he had no arms to move with, no body even to feel and touch. It was just his mind&#39;s eye that seemed to drift and see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li felt an incredible sense of disorientation. It was like he was in a fever dream, the world around him shaky and straddling the line between reality and imagination. Here, a voice resonated through his head, etching into the very essence of his thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh Great Outworlder, I hope you may forgive us for pulling you from your world, but our need is dire.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li couldn&#39;t tell whether the voice was male or female or whether it even belonged to one person or not. It was a little distorted, filled with static.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We grant you flesh and blood to walk among us. We grant you knowledge so that you may understand us and this world. We call upon you to deliver us from our woes. Our world lies at the brink of destruction. Civilization hangs in the balance. The cries of thousands echo out for you. We-&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voice crackled before cutting off. As soon as the voice stopped, the world returned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A flash of colors invaded Li in an instant as the darkness disappeared. It was incredibly disorienting gaining all five senses and a body in a single instant and he wondered it was a miracle that he did not immediately vomit his guts out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li thought to blink but realized that he physically could not. He touched his face instinctively. His hands felt cold bone. He looked at his hands again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branches. The hands of a Leshen. He looked around, startled. He processed things in chunks. First, he was outside. Second, it was nighttime. Third, he was in the middle of a great forest, but this was far different from anything in a game. None of his senses were dampened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, they were sharpened. He could so very clearly hear the wind rustling between the branches of the trees, singing out a ghostly symphony of whistles. The trees around him, their scraggly bark and their leaves, were so vividly clear, so incredibly green and black and detailed beyond anything computer graphics could provide. He could feel the soil soft and moist under his bare feet. He could smell the earthiness of the dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As absolutely unbelievable as it was, he knew this wasn&#39;t the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not just because of his senses. Whatever crazy fever dream he had hadn&#39;t just talked to his head, it had given him knowledge. He knew that he had been summoned into an entirely new world and part of the summoning ritual involved limiting any panic of confusion in being brought to a foreign world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He got the feeling that he was supposed to know more like where he was and what he was actually supposed to do, but something had gone wrong, leaving him free to do as he pleased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li&#39;s first reaction was to walk up to a tree and place his palm on its trunk. He realized then how distinctly inhuman he was. He was almost three meters tall with a body comprised of wood, leaves, and bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leshen were not friendly creatures. Nor were they particularly pleasant to look at. They were ghostly and sinister. If nature was embodied through the cycle of life and death, then the Leshen was death incarnate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li&#39;s head was a bare deer&#39;s skull lined with spiked antlers made of twisted wood. Various small branches sprouted from his body but instead of blossoming flowers, they held onto skulls of creatures both bestial and humanoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Li didn&#39;t mind his body much. It felt as natural as if it were his own. There were still a few habits he had such as wanting to blink but being unable to considering he had a skull for a head, but these he felt would fade in time. What took up most of his attention was the world around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was stunning. Li had never, ever seen a forest in real life. He had always seen them in virtual reality and historical videos and documents, but he had never dreamed he would ever be able to stand by a real tree and touch it. It was almost mythical to see something that had been lost in his world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nature was every bit as wondrous and beautiful as Li had hoped it was. Even more so than he had hoped. Warm emotions of wonder and happiness swelled within him, and he resisted an urge to cry tears of joy even knowing that his skull-head could never produce tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the only thing Li could do was be in this forest and admire it for eternity, he would still be content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li tensed up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could sense something. He instinctively attempted to look at the upper corner of his vision where a minimap would be, but of course it wasn&#39;t there. He had an idea that he had all the abilities of his game character, but he wasn&#39;t entirely sure what it felt like to use them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, something was triggering his passive [Forestborn Sense] that allowed him to detect hostile presences in a wide radius around him provided he was in a forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the game, Li&#39;s [Forestborn Sense] would manifest as a red dot marked on his minimap, but now it was more like an instinctive tug. When he followed his instincts towards the presence, the instinctive tug grew stronger, telling him he was closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li sauntered through the forest silently and swiftly. In-game, Leshen could ignore all unit-collision in a forest due to their spectral nature, letting them move through trees and individuals. He could do just the same, his body phasing through the woods. It felt a little odd to see solid objects simply pass through him, but he got used to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a minute, Li found himself on the edge of the forest. Beyond it lay a wide dirt road. He was cautious. Though he knew that he had all the powers of his level 100 game character and the voice that had summoned him called him great, he didn&#39;t know for certain how strong anything else was in this world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li hid between trees and peered into the road. Leshen also had natural stealth in forests, so he wasn&#39;t too worried of being spotted. If he was, he could also immediately escape and defend himself using an arsenal of other abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He saw an upturned wooden wagon, its wheels creaking uselessly in the air. Various kinds of vegetables lay scattered everywhere. Li could recognize some of them from his own world &ndash; carrots, cabbage, tomatoes &ndash; and others, he could recognize as belonging to Elden World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was impressive just how clearly he could see them, making out their details and colors, and he guessed that it was due to his species&#39; natural night vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surrounding the wagon were several men. Their clothing was medieval in nature and Li recognized they wore items from Elden World. Common Tunic, Common Cloak, Common Trousers, and so on. All of these were starter items, worth absolutely nothing past the first few levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The men routinely shifted their weight from one foot to the other. Some of them pulled at their hoods often to make sure the cloth was over their faces. All of them no doubt were ready to run, scared at being caught doing something wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the men knelt down and started shouting, a common dagger bared in his hand. &quot;Pay up, grandpa. You knows the law down here now. Drosso needs his tax.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li spotted who the man was talking to. It was an old man crumpled on the ground, his hands clutched around his stomach. It was obvious he had been keeled over by a blow to his belly. He too was dressed in common items. Wrinkles wreathed his hands and his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His bald head was marked with spots and scars. He was aging but still relatively stout, having a wide build used to manual labor. Even so, he couldn&#39;t fight multiple properly armed men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Curse you,&quot; spat the old man through labored breaths. &quot;I only answer to the Duchess&#39;s good law, not to some deserter styling himself a bandit king.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bandit bared his dagger in one hand and reached out an expectant hand in the other. &quot;Choose your words wisely. Duchess&#39;s perfumed knights won&#39;t be saving you anytime soon. Now give us coin. 10 silvers should let you hold onto your miserable life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man chuckled, baring a smile that had precious few teeth left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Something funny?&quot; the bandit said, the dagger nearing closer to the old man&#39;s throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You think an old farmer like me has 10 silvers?&quot; The old man weakly sat himself up. &quot;You&#39;re all delusional.&quot; He scrunched his nose. &quot;And you all smell like pigs. Clean yourselves up and get real jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Dale, just kill him and take his things,&quot; said another bandit. He licked his dirt-caked lips. &quot;We can sell them at the market later. Maybe cook ourselves a good stew first.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li didn&#39;t need to hear more. He could see his father in this old man. They were both men of the earth, farmers, strong and hardy like the dirt. He would not let low-lives that lived only off the work of others kill such a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As anger and killing intent coursed through Li, it became apparent how to use his spells and skills. All he had to do was think of the spell he wanted and it would manifest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, he casted [Power Sense], gauging the levels and stats of these bandits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their abilities manifested in his head as character profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>_______________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Bandit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level: 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Race: Human</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Class: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specialties: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stats:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STR- 20</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AGI- 15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INT- 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resistances:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armor- 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magic - 0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit- 0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Items:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Tunic (Chest)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Trousers (Legs)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Cloak (Accessory)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weapons:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dagger [Common] (One-Handed)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>____________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mismatch between these bandits and Li was like the size difference between an ant and a mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These bandits did not even have a class - that was unlocked at level 10 - and specializations, or subclasses as they were commonly known, were unlocked at level 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, Li was a level 100 Mage and Warrior hybrid with specializations as a Druid, Summoner, and Shapeshifter. His stats were absolutely maxed out. He had not come with all his items, just his coin and what was merely on his person at the time of his summoning, but that was more than enough to deal with anything of this caliber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His usually worn gear, though not equipped right now, was Celestial in rank, the rarest and strongest in all of Elden World, attainable only through hundreds of hours of grinding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his strength stat, Li could kill each of these bandits with single swipes of his claws. He could let them beat on him for a thousand years and they would never even damage him. With his agility stat, the bandits would never even be able to hit him in the first place nor would they ever be able to evade his attacks. With his insight stat, every single one of his offensive spells would turn these men into bloody smears on the ground or break their minds irreparably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a flourish of his hand, Li casted [Blood Root]. He could feel some of his mana expending. In Elden World&#39;s lore, mana was one&#39;s willpower, and the more one spent of it, the more mentally tired one became. Of course, in the game, mana use was just depicted through a blue bar in the HUD, but in this new world, it felt as it would in lore. He could feel just a little tired, as if he had spent minor brainpower looking at a document for 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li stepped out of the forest just as [Blood Root] activated. A wooden root burst up from the earth beneath the bandit threatening the old man. The root, shaped like a stake, drove straight through the bandit and reached high, skewering the bandit&#39;s body and leaving it hanging limp in the air at the tip of the root like a macabre flower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The root absorbed the bandit&#39;s blood, draining the corpse until it was nothing more than a withered husk. The blood flowed down the root and the leafy tendril pulsed grotesquely like a vein, glowing shades of crimson as it suckled hungrily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next [Blood Root] would now be even stronger. The more units it killed, the deadlier it became. Li felt no remorse killing these men. He had fought in the front-lines of war and knew what it meant to take life. One of the lessons he took to heart from war was that some lives were simply just worthless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bandits cried out in shock as they backed away from their impaled friend. Focused on the gruesome scene in front of them, the bandits did not register Li&#39;s presence, and one of them stepped back into him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bandit froze before he slowly looked up to see an antlered skull peering down at him, the empty eye sockets black like voids that seemed to suck the very soul out of his being. Before he could scream, Li grabbed his head. The bandit felt so tiny and weak in Li&#39;s grip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li crushed the bandit&#39;s head to a pulp and tossed his corpse away. It sailed several dozen meters before bursting apart on a tree trunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Run!&quot; screamed one of the bandits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li raised a finger, and another [Blood Root] emerged, tearing through the bandit&#39;s navel and bursting through his mouth, effectively silencing him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the call had been made, and the bandits scrambled away, their eyes wide with panic and their mouths open in terror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li was confident now that he had a hang of how to cast his abilities. He waved his hand and cast [Murder]. He watched as the bandits disappeared into the forest. He could give chase, but there was no use. They were all soon to be dead anyway. He instead knelt by the old man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the distance, a murder of demonic crows formed, raging through the forests and tracking down each and every bandit, tearing them limb from limb and wearing them down to the bone like a flying meat grinder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; said Li as he gently provided support for the old man&#39;s back and helped him stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Aye, I am, young&#39;un,&quot; said the old man as he thankfully patted Li&#39;s tree trunk of an arm. &quot;My, you&#39;re a big lad. And is this armor? Never felt the kind before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man&#39;s forehead wrinkled in confusion as his fingers moved up and down Li&#39;s arm. His stare was blank, looking only straight forwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li realized then that the man was blind. And thankfully too as he figured that the old man would also have been terrified if he could see Li.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, just give me a second,&quot; said Li as he gently pushed the old man aside. Li didn&#39;t want to shock the old man any further so he used his Shapeshifter abilities to morph into a human shape. In-game, this meant that he turned into a character model that he had created which had been modeled after his own features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem was, the model looked definitely East Asian, and from what Li could see, the people here were Western European. He didn&#39;t have any other human forms he could shift to since in-game, it was useless outside of cosmetics to have more than one. But this was a problem to ponder later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, Li&#39;s priority was to help this old man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I figured my armor was hurting you, so I took it off,&quot; said Li as he held the old man&#39;s arm to give him support. &quot;Feeling better?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Armor? Explains why your arm felt strange. You must be a knight then, thank the royal highness for your lot.&quot; The old man laughed. &quot;And no doubt you&#39;re a kind young lad too. It&#39;s fine if you kept your armor on, though &ndash; knight&#39;s pride and all. Old and blind I may be, I&#39;m no cripple yet. But I could still use some help. If it&#39;s no burden to you, mind helping me load my wagon again?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They loaded the wagon quickly. The old man, despite having a bruise swelling in his stomach, worked quickly and efficiently, obviously afraid the bandits might come back. Li was surprised at how nimbly the old man navigated his surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would cock his head every now and then as he tracked his broad hands across the dirt, using hearing and touch to locate each and every herb and vegetable he needed. Li realized then that the humans of this world were considerably more capable than those in his, stronger with sharper senses that allowed them to navigate themselves even while blind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the wagon finished loading, the old man sighed as he held the handles. It was a manually pushed wagon, and Li tapped the old man&#39;s shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can do that for you,&quot; Li said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m no cripple, son,&quot; said the old man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then the least I can do is escort you back to your home,&quot; said Li as his artificially human face smiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m no cripple, but I am old, I admit. I&#39;ll take that offer, aye. Lost my fighting prowess years ago, but by the gods, you should have seen me when I was young and spry,&quot; said the old man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man had a certain dignity to him that Li respected. It so very much reminded him of his father in his old age, when he coughed like mad and his arms shook so much but still insisted on loading up his delivery bike day after day. The dignity of a man who took pride in his work and himself no matter how humble it was.</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 18:15:10', '2025-04-15 18:15:10'),
(49, 19, 'Chapter 4 - A Dream Fulfilled', 'chapter-4-a-dream-fulfilled', '<p>As Li and the old man traveled to town, they talked. Or, as it was, the old man &ndash; Old Thane as he was called, for it seemed that his advanced age had become part of his identity &ndash; talked and Li listened. Old Thane liked to talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe it was because he was blind, but he talked with expression. His hands gestured wildly and his wizened brows leaped up and down, accurately conveying a vast breadth of emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Old Thane spoke of his young adventuring days, Li could see in how he raised his brows and screwed his lips the struggle of slaying an Orc Chieftain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he told the story of his late wife, how she had passed in a particularly bad winter when the winds were cold and sharp like knives, the sadness of times and love lost was visible, etched in the aged creases of his crow&#39;s feet and echoing in the melancholy of his voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane spoke of more than just himself, too. He spoke of the world, of its quarrels and events. They were right now in the duchy of Soleil ruled by the duchess Vivienne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The duchy used to be part of the Republic, an empire to the north, but a rebellion a decade ago had made it an independent territory almost as large as a kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republic was a multiracial council of several different races with elves at their head. Humans used to occupy a head seat at the council as well, but their secession was what created Soleil. Now, the two territories occupied a state of tense friendship, trading goods and diplomats but always ready to have skirmishes here and there over silly disputes over land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The place that they were headed to was a town called Riviera. A modestly sized community located in the western territory of Soleil. It was a peaceful place as far as things went, isolated from border skirmishes with the Republic to the north. The only problem were bandits and monsters, but the duchess&#39;s knights often took care of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane stopped the wagon when the moon shone brightest. He wiped a thin sheen of sweat off his forehead and took in a hungry breath of the cool, crisp night air. Li did the same, appreciating just how clean the air felt. Nothing like the smog of his world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, young&#39;un, or rather, I should call you by your name. Li, what&#39;s your story? Your name sounds foreign. You must have quite the adventures to your credit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I come from a land far away,&quot; started Li, carefully choosing his words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To the East, right? That&#39;s where your name comes from.&quot; Old Thane stroked his scraggly, grey-dotted beard. &quot;A mystical place, I hear, where three great kingdoms of jade, gold, and pearl fight unending wars for dominance. Old adventurer&#39;s tales say that they have dragons as large as mountains that rain down gold and good fortune to all that pray to them. They say that their kings live in towers that reach the skies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To be honest, my memories of home are very faint,&quot; said Li slowly. He knew nothing of this world, but he reasoned that he would be safest if he tried pretending to be part of it. He didn&#39;t like standing out in his past life, and he sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want to stand out here where he knew nothing of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, how does that come to be?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li remembered all the details of Elden World and its lore, but from what he could tell, this world was entirely different. In the game, there was no Soleil or Republic. It seemed that though this world took the magic system of the game, its history had diverged completely from it. But he was quick on his feet and tried to lie his way into belonging regardless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the right amount of vagueness and sob story to keep the questions against him low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was exiled at a young age, I&#39;m afraid. My parents had committed crimes against the state, and, through a small mercy, I was the only one allowed to leave alive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li nodded to himself. This way, he could absolve himself of knowing anything about the East while at the same time having a solid excuse to not know anything about the West. It also cut all ties he could have in the world, so he didn&#39;t have to make up any family or friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane shook his head. &quot;Exiled? How old are you? Judging by your voice, you don&#39;t even sound as if you&#39;ve passed twenty summers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m exactly twenty, sure,&quot; said Li. His real-life age was thirty, but the younger he came off as, the better. It meant he didn&#39;t have to know much about the world. He had always had a soft-spoken voice, and he guessed that Old Thane thought he was young because of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Twenty? And it must take years and years to travel from the far East to here. A boy left to the wilds, thrown to a land unknown. You must have learned to fight on the road. So much suffering all because of the sins of your parents.&quot; Old Thane bowed his head. &quot;Tell me, do you have anything to your name? Somewhere to go? Coin to your name?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Li simply. &quot;I have nothing. I&#39;ll have to find my way around this place and figure out what I want to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane furrowed his brows as he stared at the ground. He spent a minute like that, thinking hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Come with me, Li. Right outside Riviera, I have a small farm. I can&#39;t work the fields like I used to, not with my eyes dead and my arms growing thinner by the year. Sooner or later, the years shall take me and return me to the dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When that happens, I want to have a spry young lad I can pass the place down to. No sons do I have to my name, so while I understand it is not very much, I offer you a roof and, when I sod off to the afterlife, a farm. Now, what do you say to that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would want nothing else in the world,&quot; said Li, overwhelmed at the sudden offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was his dream. As if cosmic fate had heard his prayers, he could now be a farmer. What was impossible in his old life was now his. He could plant and grow life, real life, not just video game pixels, and watch the waxing and waning of seasons as the life around him grew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time since his parents passed, he felt happy. Truly happy, fulfilled at a deep, almost spiritual level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane laughed. &quot;Nothing else in the world? You&#39;ve got small ambitions, my friend, but I admire that. It&#39;s no good to be weighed down by heavy dreams. Come, let&#39;s head to Riviera. My old back is looking forward taking a rest with a strong young&#39;un like you to man the plows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so they went, starting the story of a peculiar young farmer whose power could rock the world.</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 18:15:41', '2025-04-15 18:15:41'),
(50, 19, 'Chapter 5 - A Farmer\'s Toils I', 'chapter-5-a-farmers-toils-i', '<p>Over the course of a month, Li dove into the world of farming with reckless abandon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, it was almost like sitting through university lectures, simply following Old Thane throughout the day and listening to explanations of what he did. Whatever Old Thane taught him, Li absorbed like a sponge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li realized very soon that he knew precious little of actual farming. He knew the hard science behind it because he had studied it, but actually getting his hands dirty was a whole different beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were so many things that had not been mentioned in his textbooks. Mostly because farming by hand had long been eradicated, replaced with efficient machinery and GMO crops. He knew that a field had to be plowed, but he didn&#39;t know the exact pattern of furrows to make in the land to maximize growth. He knew seeds had to be sown, but he didn&#39;t know how deep to dig to plant in and how far apart each seed should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, the farming system in the Elden World game which consisted only of planting, watering, and growing was a joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane grew wheat, or rather, tried to grow wheat. He hadn&#39;t had a successful harvest in almost twenty years, not since he had lost his wife and, very soon after, his sight. He still plowed the field and sowed the seeds, but it was more of a formality at this point, an ode to his pride that he could still get out there and sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losing his sight meant that he couldn&#39;t efficiently put in the time and care to grow the wheat, so come every year during this time when summer was at its wane, his crop never seemed to take to life and his fields were dull and lifeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was actually a wonder that Old Thane could survive, but he managed with berries. To the left of the cottage was a large garden fenced with thin wood. In it, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries grew aplenty, dotting great big bushes of green with shiny spots of red and blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane could manage the berries well enough even while blind, knowing with almost a supernatural sense the fullness of a bush and how and where to prune it. Because the garden was comparatively much smaller than the field, it was also a manageable workload for a blind man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two sections in the berry garden. One for those ripe and another for those growing. Combined, they provided a yearlong supply of food and, most importantly, were valuable to trade for necessities like vegetables, meat, and bread. Li had actually first met him on the forest trail on a return trip from having traded much of his berries for needed goods and foodstuffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the right of the cottage was another garden, but it had fallen into disarray. There was a rotted fence that barely managed to contain massive growths of weeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane had explained that his late wife had been a herbalist and used it to grow her herbs, but when she died, her knowledge went with her. Old Thane had tried to keep the herbs alive, but he was a farmer of the earth, of wheat and berries, not the mystical, of goblinseed flax and emberbloom roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Li learned and listened, he knew that in all reality, he could make everything grow aplenty. He was a druid of the highest caliber and among his spell arsenal was [Wild Growth] which would massively accelerate the growth of any plant. He could summon creatures to kill any pests. He could even change the weather to never make harvests fail. He also had been transported here with his prized seedbag containing the rarest plants in Elden World, but judging by the equipment level of this new world, planting anything from that bag was a surefire way to get massively unwanted attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li didn&#39;t want to do that and he didn&#39;t want to use godlike magic to make things work for him. He wanted to live a simple life with his own two hands and nothing more. He was satisfied enough already with his current life that many times he forgot he likely had the power to completely rule this world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just like that, Li, level 100 mage, controller of the cycle of life and death, eldritch druid of the dark arts, became a simple farmer. He fell into a simple routine, waking up at first light to help Old Thane pluck weeds from the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering it was late summer, the wheat should already have grown out into golden stalks by now, almost ready for harvesting, but it seemed Old Thane&#39;s field was barren once more. Li mostly went to the berry garden and pruned bushes that were getting too thick, always replaying the techniques that Old Thane had taught him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunlight faded quickly, even during summer. Li realized just how much longer days were in a world where electronic lights stood everywhere. Here, where the only light came from the sun, fireplaces, and the occasional lantern, the days ended almost as soon as afternoon came. When the sun began to set, painting the sky in beautiful ambers and warm oranges, Li and Old Thane went back to the cottage, washed up in a large wooden basin placed outside, and had dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Today marks the end of month 1 of your apprenticeship,&quot; said Old Thane as he felt around the table for a loaf of bread. His tawny hand found a breadbasket and withdrew a loaf. He plunged a dull knife into homemade blueberry jam and spread it across the loaf. &quot;How are you liking it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s all that I expected and more,&quot; said Li. He also grabbed a loaf and tore it in half. He always ate little so that there was enough food for Old Thane. In the first place, Li didn&#39;t have to eat. As a spectral being, he faced no hunger or thirst. But he couldn&#39;t let Old Thane know that. &quot;Place is surprisingly big. I thought life would be much rougher, but it&#39;s truly interesting how magic makes things easier.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was true that Li thought medieval life was horrible. All the historical documents suggested that. Limited access to food, clean water, and medical science meant people in this age died faster and more often. But in this new world, the presence of magic alleviated many of these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane&#39;s pantry had a vitality rune inscribed on it that slowed food in it from spoiling. Quite like a refrigerator, actually. Then there was the water. By buying pebbles enchanted with purification runes at the local runesmith, one could drop them in buckets of water and purify them of parasites and scum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vitality and purification runes in the game were only used to give weapons extra durability and holy damage respectively, so it was interesting how the magic in Elden World was adapted to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There also wasn&#39;t a lack of water &ndash; Riviera had a magically operated aqueduct system that linked to a nearby lake. It was just a matter of hauling buckets of water from the city to the cottage, but Li&#39;s supernatural strength made short work of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, Li did feel like he was cheating in some regard. He never had to eat or sleep. He never tired. He was stronger and faster than any man. There was no risk involved for him. If his harvest failed, he wasn&#39;t in risk of starving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he still loved the actual job aspect of the work. He didn&#39;t treat farming so much as a means of survival as it was an art. His passion didn&#39;t come from a basic need to keep himself alive but an appreciation of the beauty of working with precious nature that had rotted away in his world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also another thing that Li couldn&#39;t quite place. He was changing. The more time he spent here, the more he grew connected to the plants around him. He could feel their life emanating strongly like the warmth of human&#39;s skin. If he focused, he felt like he could even hear their breathing, how they breathed in carbon dioxide through their stomata and breathed out pure and clean oxygen. He enjoyed these feelings and didn&#39;t think too much of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nor did he think of anything else related to himself. He didn&#39;t agonize over the nature of his vast power or how his human mind would work in the body of an eldritch forest creature that was both demon and god.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were certain things he was grateful for such as the fact that his race had Allspeak, allowing him to communicate both verbally and in written form to any sentient being, but if it didn&#39;t directly affect his farming, he thought little of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane chewed on his bread absent-mindedly. &quot;Glad to hear my company hasn&#39;t worn you out yet. Couldn&#39;t say the same about some others, hah! It also warms my heart that you&#39;re here, Li, and you&#39;re right: the cottage is big.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was meant to house a family. Fate, though, is a fickle mistress. She blesses me with Aine, the most beautiful woman I ever knew &ndash; you should have seen her, radiant as the sun, hair gold like summer wheat - as wife but makes her barren and takes her away far too early. I still hate how she went. How I just lost her to that snowstorm. Couldn&#39;t even find her body to bury her and give her good spirit some respect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li cupped his hands together as a solemn gesture. Old Thane still grieved for his lost wife and remembering her still opened old wounds. It was the only time he was ever vulnerable or down, any other time he was as cheery as the sun. But Li had rummaged through the cottage and planned a way to maybe make things better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, I was looking through some books in the storage,&quot; said Li.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Which ones?&quot; said Old Thane. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t judge an old man too much for his taste in indecent literature when he was young. Gods, I remember how Aine tried to burn all of it when she found them. But an adventurer always knows how to keep his supplies safe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane let out a hearty laugh. His laugh always sounded far younger than he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not those, books from your wife,&quot; said Li, smiling. Old Thane grew quiet. Li continued. &quot;Aine was a herbalist, right? She has so many books about what herbs to grow for elixirs and salves. All of them marked with so many notes. It&#39;s obvious she loved her work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane leaned back in his chair. The rickety thing squeaked under his weight. &quot;Aye, that she did. Damn good at it, too. My hardheaded brain was never suited to remembering all those details about this flower or that herb, but Aine was mighty sharp. A genius, I reckon, and she loved those herbs like they were children. It was no wonder adventurers clamored to come here for elixir ingredients.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shook his head and tugged at his beard. &quot;A crying shame I grew blind and let them rot. My only real memory of her, and I let them rot. My only real regret in life, I should say.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I want to start the herb garden again,&quot; said Li. &quot;Her notes are detailed enough that I can easily start it again. Most importantly, though, I want to honor Aine&#39;s memory for you. I know it doesn&#39;t make up for the fact that she never received a proper burial, but the very least we could do is bless her memory by continuing her legacy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane took a few seconds to digest what Li said. He put his bread down. He buried his face into his callused hands. At first, Li thought he was crying, maybe overwhelmed with emotion, but that wasn&#39;t the case. He breathed in calm, even intervals, but there was still a tenseness to his silence that made it awkward for Li to say anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a minute, Old Thane dropped his hands to his sides, shook his head vigorously as if to rouse himself awake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Forgive me, Li,&quot; he said. &quot;That was unseemly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li leaned forwards, ready to stand and help the aging man with anything. &quot;You okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane smiled, defusing any tension in the air. &quot;No need to worry, lad. I was just thinking how utterly daft I was for never even thinking to replant those herbs since you got here. I always cursed myself for my blindness, always telling myself as those herbs rotted that one day, if I ever had the means, I would replant Aine&#39;s life&#39;s work, and yet, when you came into my home, the only thing I could think about was my own legacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All I cared was for you to tend to my own farm. As soon as you came here, I should have gotten on my knees and begged you to replant those herbs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane pushed his chair in with renewed energy. &quot;But no more shall I wallow in self-pity and mistakes. Come, Li! Let us dally no longer! We will head to the nearest village and buy all the seeds we need. Tomorrow, we will clear that weed-infested garden and make it fit for Aine&#39;s glorious memory!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now?&quot; said Li. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be lazy, I&#39;m just worried. It&#39;s dark out, and dark is when vermin crawl out. The bandits I took care of might not be all of them. Why don&#39;t we go to Riviera instead? The city marketplace is open day and night with knightsguard patrolling about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bah, those city cheats charge outrageous amounts for everything,&quot; said Old Thane with disdain. &quot;And they only take coin, which I have precious little of. It&#39;s easier for me to trade our berries off. As for safety, I reckon the two of us could give any ragtag group of skinny bandit thugs a beating hard enough to rouse them into proper work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, I guess that makes sense.&quot; Li said this more to keep the old man happy. If he wanted, he could use the ample coin in his inventory to pay, but then he would have to answer where he got the coin, and he didn&#39;t want to think too hard of an excuse. And it was true that there was no bandit that could pose a serious threat to Li.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit, lad!&quot; Old Thane rushed into his room and came out wearing a thick tunic over his linen shirt. &quot;Wear something warm and let&#39;s go load the wagon! My, how my blood boils, I thought I lost this impulsive drive when I settled down!&quot;</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 18:16:10', '2025-04-15 18:16:10'),
(51, 19, 'Chapter 6 - A Farmer\'s Toils II', 'chapter-6-a-farmers-toils-ii', '<p>Li and Old Thane followed the main road their cottage stood by. It led out from Riviera&#39;s main gate and into a great forest called the Winterwoods, so called for how unnaturally cold it became during winters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You should feel the grass during winter,&quot; said Old Thane as he pulled his wagon. It was loaded to the brim with berries. His boots crushed thickets of tall grass underfoot with each step. &quot;Some adventurers come out of here and need to have their feet cut. The cold rot turns them black and as hard and brittle as ice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And how do you manage?&quot; said Li. Cold rot, as far as Li could tell from the symptoms he&#39;d heard and read about, was what the people of this world called gangrene. He walked by Old Thane, feeling a little bad he wasn&#39;t doing any work other than being on guard duty, but the old man was too stubborn to let go of the wagon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m from the north, lad,&quot; said Old Thane with pride. &quot;We brave winters far harsher than what these southern pups yelp at.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gritting his teeth, Old Thane picked up the pace as he hefted the wagon through the Winterwoods. Normally, he talked much while walking, but right now, he was focused on getting to Modeste, the nearest village, as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li did notice that Old Thane&#39;s accent was far different than anyone else&#39;s here. In real life terms, Old Thane&#39;s accent sounded Scottish while the regular Rivieran had a heavy French accent. Li&#39;s accent was apparently quite eloquent, sounding proper and enunciated like a noble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li didn&#39;t have much chance to really explore this world, busy as he was with farming, so he still learned many things as he went. He barely interacted with anyone other than Old Thane, and, on the old man&#39;s recommendation, always wore a hood when he went outside to prevent people from noticing that he was foreign. On top of that, he had switched out his Celestial robes to shabby common wear to fit in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But really, in the end, he didn&#39;t care much about the world - his only world was the farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trip to Modeste was two hours long on foot, but just shy of an hour in, there came a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road was blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not by bandits, thankfully, but knights. Three knights stood guard on the road, their blades and shields drawn. Their armor glinted silver under the moonlight, their thick, bucket-shaped helms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind them, the forest had been cleared just enough to form a rudimentary camp. There were eight tents emblazoned with insignia bearing a purple rose. The coat of arms of the Lys, ruling family of Riviera. One of the four major noble families under the duchess Vivienne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the middle of the tents was a blazing campfire with a pot of stew boiling atop it. Amid a makeshift bench hewn out of a fallen log, six more knights sat, chatting and drinking with their armor off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Halt,&quot; said one of the guarding knights lazily. It was evident he was quite tired. &quot;The road is blocked on order of lord Dulance Lys.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed Old Thane. He dropped the wagon and walked up to the knight. The knight stiffened a little but relaxed when he realized Old Thane was blind. &quot;For what reason?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re on royal assignment to rid these woods of the deserter Drosso and his band of thieves.&quot; The knight took a pitying look at Old Thane. &quot;If you wish to spend the night in our camp and head back under the safety of the sun, you may.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A good offer, my friend, but pray, do tell, how long will this blockade last?&quot; said Old Thane, his brows furrowed in anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bandit scum here multiply and hide like rats. Lord Lys intends to root out every single thug and hang them in the name of the good duchess.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How long?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knight shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Perhaps two weeks, maybe more. But fear not, we, the knights of Lys, are renowned for our bladework. You shall walk this road untouched very soon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane shook his head and came back to Li. &quot;This is awful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why?&quot; said Li. &quot;Can&#39;t we come back in a week or whenever they&#39;re done?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our food, Li. It&#39;s been a month since I made this trip last, when I met you. We&#39;re running out. We&#39;ll have to trade at Riviera, but my berries will fetch so little coin that even two days&#39; worth of bread will be hard to come by.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li understood. He hadn&#39;t cared that the food was running out because he didn&#39;t need it to survive. Old Thane probably thought Li was just being polite. Li felt a twinge of guilt for not considering that Old Thane was only human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Two weeks, maybe more &ndash; with two of us eating, we&#39;ll have nothing,&quot; worried Old Thane. &quot;I may have to sell the field, barren as it may be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That settled it. For almost thirty years, he had dreamed of being a farmer, and now he was living his dream. The farm was his passion. His golden treasure.

Not lords, not kings, not demons, not gods, least of all bandits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li reached out and squeezed Old Thane&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, old man, you won&#39;t have to sacrifice anything. Stay the night at this camp where you&#39;ll be safe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane grabbed Li&#39;s arm with trembling hands. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything stupid, lad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t you worry.&quot; Li smiled as he pried Old Thane&#39;s hands away. He patted the old man&#39;s back and cast [Deathbloom Triggerseed], placing a nondescript, tiny little black seed on his shirt. If the old man was attacked, then the seed would sprout, protecting him in an enclosure of defensive vines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I make this promise to you,&quot; said Li as he started walking away, down the road and into the dark. &quot;You wanted your farm to live beyond you, right? To pass it down to me and see your life&#39;s work continue. Well, I swear to you that your farm will never fall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something came over Li. His words felt strange, almost disembodied, as if someone else was speaking for him, but he knew that they were the words he wanted to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your work will triumph over the tests of time.

This, I promise and more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever came over him left almost as soon as it arose, and Li left Old Thane in an understandably confused state. Li understood that he would have to explain what he did and what he said later, but over a month of living with Old Thane, he trusted the kindly old man to keep his lips sealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Li had some pest control to do.</p>', 6, '2025-04-15 18:16:32', '2025-04-15 18:16:32');

It led out from Riviera&#39;s main gate and into a great forest called the Winterwoods, so called for how unnaturally cold it became during winters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You should feel the grass during winter,&quot; said Old Thane as he pulled his wagon. It was loaded to the brim with berries. His boots crushed thickets of tall grass underfoot with each step. &quot;Some adventurers come out of here and need to have their feet cut. The cold rot turns them black and as hard and brittle as ice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And how do you manage?&quot; said Li. Cold rot, as far as Li could tell from the symptoms he&#39;d heard and read about, was what the people of this world called gangrene. He walked by Old Thane, feeling a little bad he wasn&#39;t doing any work other than being on guard duty, but the old man was too stubborn to let go of the wagon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m from the north, lad,&quot; said Old Thane with pride. &quot;We brave winters far harsher than what these southern pups yelp at.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gritting his teeth, Old Thane picked up the pace as he hefted the wagon through the Winterwoods. Normally, he talked much while walking, but right now, he was focused on getting to Modeste, the nearest village, as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li did notice that Old Thane&#39;s accent was far different than anyone else&#39;s here. In real life terms, Old Thane&#39;s accent sounded Scottish while the regular Rivieran had a heavy French accent. Li&#39;s accent was apparently quite eloquent, sounding proper and enunciated like a noble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li didn&#39;t have much chance to really explore this world, busy as he was with farming, so he still learned many things as he went. He barely interacted with anyone other than Old Thane, and, on the old man&#39;s recommendation, always wore a hood when he went outside to prevent people from noticing that he was foreign. On top of that, he had switched out his Celestial robes to shabby common wear to fit in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But really, in the end, he didn&#39;t care much about the world - his only world was the farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trip to Modeste was two hours long on foot, but just shy of an hour in, there came a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road was blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not by bandits, thankfully, but knights. Three knights stood guard on the road, their blades and shields drawn. Their armor glinted silver under the moonlight, their thick, bucket-shaped helms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind them, the forest had been cleared just enough to form a rudimentary camp. There were eight tents emblazoned with insignia bearing a purple rose. The coat of arms of the Lys, ruling family of Riviera. One of the four major noble families under the duchess Vivienne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the middle of the tents was a blazing campfire with a pot of stew boiling atop it. Amid a makeshift bench hewn out of a fallen log, six more knights sat, chatting and drinking with their armor off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Halt,&quot; said one of the guarding knights lazily. It was evident he was quite tired. &quot;The road is blocked on order of lord Dulance Lys.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed Old Thane. He dropped the wagon and walked up to the knight. The knight stiffened a little but relaxed when he realized Old Thane was blind. &quot;For what reason?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re on royal assignment to rid these woods of the deserter Drosso and his band of thieves.&quot; The knight took a pitying look at Old Thane. &quot;If you wish to spend the night in our camp and head back under the safety of the sun, you may.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A good offer, my friend, but pray, do tell, how long will this blockade last?&quot; said Old Thane, his brows furrowed in anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bandit scum here multiply and hide like rats. Lord Lys intends to root out every single thug and hang them in the name of the good duchess.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How long?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knight shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Perhaps two weeks, maybe more. But fear not, we, the knights of Lys, are renowned for our bladework. You shall walk this road untouched very soon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Thane shook his head and came back to Li. &quot;This is awful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why?&quot; said Li. &quot;Can&#39;t we come back in a week or whenever they&#39;re done?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our food, Li. It&#39;s been a month since I made this trip last, when I met you. We&#39;re running out. We&#39;ll have to trade at Riviera, but my berries will fetch so little coin that even two days&#39; worth of bread will be hard to come by.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li understood. He hadn&#39;t cared that the food was running out because he didn&#39;t need it to survive. Old Thane probably thought Li was just being polite. Li felt a twinge of guilt for not considering that Old Thane was only human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Two weeks, maybe more &ndash; with two of us eating, we&#39;ll have nothing,&quot; worried Old Thane. &quot;I may have to sell the field, barren as it may be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That settled it. For almost thirty years, he had dreamed of being a farmer, and now he was living his dream. The farm was his passion. His golden treasure. His art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing, absolutely nothing, would stand between Li and the farm. Not lords, not kings, not demons, not gods, least of all bandits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li reached out and squeezed Old Thane&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, old man, you won&#39;t have to sacrifice anything.

(53, 20, 'Chapter 1 – The Banished Battle God', 'chapter-1-the-banished-battle-god', '<p>Click click, tap tap... ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pair of nimble hands fluttered across the keyboard and mouse. The rhythm of the rapping sounds produced were like a lively symphony. The screen flashed with bright light and the opponent fell to the ground in a spray of blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha.&rdquo; Ye Qiu laughed as he lifted his hand to take the cigarette that was held in the corner of his mouth. The silver white smoke had already formed into a long cloud, but Ye Qiu continued with his work, brandishing his mouse and striking his keyboard, not in the least bit shaken. The removed cigarette was quickly extinguished in an eccentrically-shaped ashtray on the table. Ye Qiu&rsquo;s hand quickly flew back to the keyboard. Right when he was about to say a few words to his opponent, the door of his room was suddenly pushed open with a &lsquo;bang&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu didn&rsquo;t turn his head as if he had been waiting for this moment, merely asking: &ldquo;Arrived?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Arrived.&rdquo; Su Mucheng also replied simply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Ye Qiu once again declined his opponent&rsquo;s request for a duel. He gently removed the card from Glory&rsquo;s dedicated log-in device. He headed to the door and grabbed a jacket from a clothes hanger on his way out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The night had already darkened considerably, but Club Excellent Era&rsquo;s lights were still bright. Ye Qiu and Su Mucheng walked out of a room and walked all the way to the end of the corridor. Located here was a spacious conference room; at the entrance, digital display screens almost completely covered the walls. They showed the rankings of the &ldquo;Glory Professional Alliance&rdquo; and a few skill statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranking: Excellent Era Battle Team ranked number 19 &mdash; second to last place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a trump card team with three consecutive titles as Champions in the league, there former achievements were exceptionally dazzling. Now it hung brightly on the wall as if heartlessly mocking everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The atmosphere in the room wasn&rsquo;t heavy. On the contrary, it was somewhat friendly. The members of Excellent Era were all gathered around one person as if they were stars surrounding the moon. They ignored Ye Qiu&rsquo;s arrival and the ones that did, quickly swept over him with expressions of coldness and mockery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ye Qiu, the club has already decided that the transfer member Sun Xiang will take over your position as captain. From now on, Sun Xiang will be in control of your account One Autumn Leaf.&rdquo; Club Manager saw the arrival of Ye Qiu and immediately turned his head to speak. Without saying it in advance or conveying it tactfully, he heartlessly notified him in an ice-cold manner as if he were throwing away a ball of already-used toilet paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Mucheng opened her mouth wanting to speak, but Ye Qiu lightly tugged at her sleeve. He smiled and nodded his head at her indicating that he wasn&rsquo;t surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Ye, I&rsquo;m sorry, on arriving, I just took your position.&rdquo; On the left hand side of the conference table &mdash;&mdash; the exclusive seat for Excellent Era&rsquo;s team captain should have been Ye Qiu&rsquo;s seat. But Sun Xiang casually sat there as he said these few words. However, his eye didn&rsquo;t even glance at Ye Qiu. This was already no longer ignorance, rather it was a type of disregard. His gaze fell upon Su Mucheng&rsquo;s body who had arrived with Ye Qiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, Su Mucheng was indeed more attractive to the eye than Ye Qiu. She was known as the Glory Professional Alliance&rsquo;s number one beauty. Even if she was thrown into the show business, she would still be considered a rare beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even for those Excellent Era members who could see her everyday, they were still somewhat stunned when they saw Su Mucheng enter. Only they quickly recovered because there was another important person that deserved their attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, Brother Xiang, with those words, this position definitely suits you.&rdquo; Everyone that had recovered promptly scrambled for their lines after he said this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right, some people are already old and out-of-date!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One Autumn Leaf really should follow Brother Xiang&rsquo;s commands so that our abilities can truly be displayed as battle strength!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the focus that everyone payed attention to at this moment &mdash; Sun Xiang, Glory Professional Alliance generation&rsquo;s genius level player. In the league last season, Sun Xiang won the Most Outstanding Rookie title with his MVP-like stats and led the mediocre Over the Clouds Team to eighth place. His advance to the playoffs was hopeful, but midway, he transferred to the collapsing Excellent Era Club. Although Excellent Era&rsquo;s accomplishments were terrible, they possessed a player who was regarded as a Battle God in Glory: Battle Mage One Autumn Leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Excellent Era members actually shamelessly approached Sun Xiang, who hadn&rsquo;t even been a part of the Alliance for two years. It was clear that Sun Xiang would be the future leader of the team. Sun Xiang comfortably accepted their flattery and was unwilling to part with it so much so that he wouldn&rsquo;t glance at Ye Qiu; feeling that such an action was beneath him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ye Qiu, hand over your account card for One Autumn Leaf to Sun Xiang!&rdquo; the team manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if Ye Qiu was unfazed before, at this moment, his heart couldn&rsquo;t help but feel somewhat hurt. Ye Qiu, One Autumn Leaf, the relationship between these two names was obvious. (TLNote: Ye Qiu means Autumn Leaf). This was the name he had created when he entered the online game world of Glory. This account had accompanied Ye Qiu for a full ten years. Originally, the newbie became known as a textbook level expert. The insignificant battle mage also turned into the famed &ldquo;Battle God&rdquo; in Glory. But seven years ago when he entered the professional circle, he signed a business contract with the club and all the rights to One Autumn Leaf transferred to the club. Ye Qiu had known that there would be a day they would separate and this day finally arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu&rsquo;s fingers slightly trembled. To a pro-player, steady hands were a must. This inner quality could not be ingrained any further into the old veteran&rsquo;s body but right now, Ye Qiu&rsquo;s hands were trembling. Su Mucheng twisted her head. She did not want to see this scene, but was powerless to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone took delight in his misfortune as One Autumn Leaf, that silver white account card, was handed over to Sun Xiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun Xiang&rsquo;s eyes lit up with greed and happiness. He had willingly transferred and joined the inferior Excellent Era Club in order to have One Autumn Leaf&rsquo;s account. One Autumn Leaf&rsquo;s former owner Ye Qiu&rsquo;s achievements were not good in the last few years and he often broke out in arguments with the club. Sun Xiang had 100% confidence in replacing him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; In the instant he retrieved the card, Sun Xiang felt a burst of excitement but felt a trace of resistance from the card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun Xiang felt Ye Qiu&rsquo;s reluctance and proudly chortled: &ldquo;Let go Brother Ye. Your hands are unexpectedly shaking to this degree. With these hands how are you going to display your power as a Battle God? Better to let me do it! I&rsquo;ll let the title Battle God to once again echo throughout Glory. You? Retire!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After saying this, Sun Xiang saw that silent Ye Qiu, who just only handed over One Autumn Leaf, had a hint of pain flash across his eyes. He discovered in shock that Ye Qiu&rsquo;s trembling hands suddenly steadied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you like this game?&rdquo; Ye Qiu suddenly asked looking straight at Sun Xiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sun Xiang startled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you like it, then treat everything as glory and not boasting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What did you say? What does this have to do with you?&rdquo; Sun Xiang suddenly lost control. At the moment, he didn&rsquo;t know why he felt that he was lower than Ye Qiu by a head. He didn&rsquo;t think that he would lose to his opponent in loftiness. He came here in order to replace Ye Qiu. He came here to take the Battle God One Autumn Life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Put it away.&rdquo; Just when Sun Xiang wanted to summon up his loftiness, Ye Qiu already let go of the account card faintly saying the phrase. He turned around ready to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ye Qiu!&rdquo; At this moment, the manager suddenly called out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu stopped and tilted his head slightly to the side hearing that the manager was already behind him saying: &ldquo;The club currently doesn&rsquo;t have any suitable competitive cards to give you. First find a team member to serve as a training partner!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training partner... ... A person who built a dynasty in the Alliance and an expert known by all in Glory had actually fallen to be a training partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun Xiang was very interested in this arrangement and immediately laughed out loud: &ldquo;With Brother Ye&rsquo;s level, training together won&rsquo;t be a problem. Only you deserve to be Glory Professional Alliance&rsquo;s number one training partner!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha.&rdquo; Accepting the insult, Ye Qiu unexpectedly laughed. He turned his body towards the manager: &ldquo;Training partner? It looks like I don&rsquo;t have to. I cancel the contract!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cancel the contract? Are you actively seeking to cancel the contract?&rdquo; The manager&rsquo;s expression looked as if she were in deep thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right. I request to cancel the contract.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dont be rash!&rdquo; Su Mu Cheng immediately came charging over to stop Ye Qiu. An Alliance had an Alliance&rsquo;s rules. Terminating a contract during the contract period required a special reason. Actively seeking to cancel the contract required a penalty fee. Ye Qiu and Excellent Era still had another half a year for the contract. If he were to forcefully request a termination of the contract, then the loss would be huge. As for Su Mucheng, she feared Ye Qiu&rsquo;s departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The boss isn&rsquo;t here yet, wait for him to come before you continue speaking!&rdquo; Su Mucheng hoped Ye Qiu would calm down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu had noticed the trace of ridicule at the corners of the manager&rsquo;s mouth long ago. He shook his head towards Su Mucheng and laughed bitterly: &ldquo;Mu Cheng, do you not understand? My departure is the boss&rsquo;s goal. I no longer have any value to this club. I&rsquo;m only a money sink.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No way. How could you be a money sink? Your strength wouldn&rsquo;t lose to anyone.&rdquo; Su Mucheng said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Strength isn&rsquo;t the issue. This is a business. And me? I&rsquo;ve never had any business value.&rdquo; Ye Qiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You originally did have value, but you chose to give it up yourself.&rdquo; The manager coldly interjected at this moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right, this is my choice.&rdquo; Ye Qiu said. The current Glory Professional Alliance was flourishing, sponsors flocked over left and right. Celebrity players in Glory were natural advertisers as spokespeople for popular goods. But even though Ye Qiu was viewed as a top-tier level player, he rejected any offer to be in advertisements. He even refused to take part in interviews or news conferences. He was like an ancient netizen, carefully concealing his true identity in virtual reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club was extremely dissatisfied with this matter. They looked at him as if he were a gold mountain but were unable to dig out even the slightest amount of gold. They were only able to put up with him because his strength was tyrannical, helping the Club gain fame and glory. But as their achievements declined, everything had already become of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Alliance&rsquo;s commercialization allowed us to survive, but now... ...&rdquo; Ye Qiu couldn&rsquo;t say anything further. He also didn&rsquo;t know whether this development was good or bad. The current Alliance was full of greed. Every Alliance boss&rsquo;s first consideration was how to exploit the team to make a profit. Harboring a love for gaming and tirelessly struggling in Glory, Ye Qiu cherished his memories for the Alliance when it had just been made. But now, the Alliance only strived for money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su Mucheng did not say another word. She had originally come with Ye Qiu here and witnessed everything about this old veteran. Her eyes were filled with tears. She knew that Ye Qiu truly wanted to leave. Blocking him would only make it more painful for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s like this, I... ...&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; Ye Qiu smiled interrupting Su Mucheng. He knew what she wanted to say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I haven&rsquo;t given up all hope yet. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right. This is the ambitious Ye Qiu I recognize. Then first, let&rsquo;s talk about the penalty fee! Honestly speaking, you&rsquo;ve been with us for so many years and your achievements have been high so we won&rsquo;t push it. If you want to leave, then let&rsquo;s all sit down and talk about the details of cancelling the contract. How about it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tell it to me straight. What are the conditions?&rdquo; Ye Qiu asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay. The conditions are simple: announce your retirement.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Retirement! This condition can&rsquo;t be avoided?&rdquo; Su Mucheng was very angry. Ye Qiu was 25 years old this year. With regards to pro-gamers in electronic gaming tournaments, this age was already considered high. Retiring at this age was not at all strange. But Ye Qiu already stated clearly that he did not want to retire. The Excellent Era manager&rsquo;s condition of retirement was clearly directed against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retired pro-players naturally did not have the qualifications to participate in a tournament again. Although retired pro-players could come back, Glory Professional Alliance had a rule stating that a retired pro-player could only return after a year. This was to prevent people from transferring to another team and then returning the next day. Ye Qiu was already in the declining years of this profession. Every day was precious, but now they wanted him to waste a year. After one year, even if he wanted to return again, for the elderly, without a year of intense competition to maintain his skills and even by relying on former fame, whether the team would still want him would be an issue. In addition, Ye Qiu had a fatal flaw: he refused to do anything related to business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looked as if it were an impossible condition, but Ye Qiu simply nodded his head: &ldquo;I accept.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; Su Mucheng alarmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked so hard for so many years, can&rsquo;t I rest for a year?&rdquo; Ye Qiu smiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What... ... what are you thinking of doing?&rdquo; Su Mucheng didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing much.&rdquo; Ye Qiu turned his head. The manager had already handed over the documents. Ye Qiu took a glance at them and laughed a bit. The other party really had prepared for this long ago! Thinking of this, Ye Qiu put the pen to the paper and quickly signed his name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he was about to leave... ... Ye Qiu glanced back at this place he had stayed for seven years. He didn&rsquo;t say any farewells and silently turned his body ready to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you off.&rdquo; Su Mucheng was the only one to follow behind him.</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 18:20:04', '2025-04-15 18:20:04'),
(54, 20, 'Chapter 2 – Area 3 Number 47', 'chapter-2-area-3-number-47', '<p>Chapter 2 &ndash; Area 3 Number 47</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Chie, who do you think you are!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Letting him retire is for his sake. What else can he do?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right right. As tactful as he is, he wouldn&rsquo;t think to blame the club for retiring him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu and Su MuCheng left. Everyone else in the conference room suddenly recovered and began mocking him again. But Sun Xian&rsquo;s expression was mixed. He did not participate and moved closer to the manager instead: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. How could he have accepted these conditions?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He had no other choice but to accept.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because he can&rsquo;t pay the penalty fee.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How... ... How can that be?&rdquo; Sun Xiang was stunned. Ye Qiu had worked hard as a professional gamer for seven years and was also at the peak. Even if he had refused all business related matters, his salary shouldn&rsquo;t have been so low that he would be unable to pay for the penalty fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t in that generation, so you wouldn&rsquo;t know. In the Alliance&rsquo;s initial stages, the Alliance pro-players were nowhere near as impressive as now. At that time, the pro-players that had been fired ended up in terrible situations Most of their youth had been used up on gaming. But none of them were skilled enough and most of them fell into dire financial straits. Ye Qiu was that era&rsquo;s genius and we relied on his achievements to get to where we are today. But he had a lot of friends like that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So what you&rsquo;re saying is that most of his assets were given to those friends?&rdquo; Sun Xiang&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then if he needed the money, why would he refuse to accept business activities?&rdquo; Sun Xiang asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No one knows the reason for this.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any guesses?&rdquo; Sun Xiang asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It might have something to do with his family.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No one knows anything about his family. He also never talks about them. It&rsquo;s very strange, which is why I suspect it.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This person .... ... has a lot of stories!&rdquo; Sun Xiang lifted up the One Autumn Leaf card that Ye Qiu gave him. He knew that Ye Qiu had made this account long before the Professional Alliance had been created. Used all the way up until now, this card was one of Glory&rsquo;s oldest accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s not talk about him anymore. The boss is busy today and can&rsquo;t come. But he gave me this bottle of aged red wine from his collection just for your welcoming.&rdquo; the manager said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, thank you very much! With me, Excellent Era will shine once again!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su MuCheng stood in front of the club&rsquo;s entrance. She stood like this until Ye Qiu disappeared into the distance. He repeatedly turned around to wave his hand. Tears had already begun streaming down Su MuCheng&rsquo;s cheeks long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without saying too much, Ye Qiu said a total of eight words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest a year and then come back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Su MuCheng did not say another word. She only nodded her head again and again. She was no longer that innocent young girl and had already assumed a lot of responsibilities alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snowflakes floated in the air. This winter was very cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snowing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Ye Qiu left the club, he hadn&rsquo;t thought of the next step. Having grown accustomed to a lifestyle for so many years, he had not yet adapted to the sudden change yet. He wanted to walk along like this until his thoughts cleared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who knew that the weather wouldn&rsquo;t give him this opportunity? At this moment, snow began to fall moreover more and more fell as time went on. Flying snowflakes quickly hit him wetting his shoulders. Icicles also formed on his head. If he didn&rsquo;t take shelter, he would die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu looked around left and right and saw an Internet Cafe along the road. The lights were still brightly lit this late at night and he dashed towards it at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet Cafe was nice and warm.Ye Qiu burst in and shook the snowflakes off of his body and went up to the reception desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Area 3 Number 47.&rdquo; The young lady at the reception desk informed him of an open computer. She soon handed over an ID card to boot up the computer only to see that he had already left. The young lady didn&rsquo;t fuss over it. This type of matter evidently happened quite often. She silently put away the ID card knowing that he would have to come back to get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Area 3 Number 47, Ye Qiu followed the signs searching. This Internet Cafe wasn&rsquo;t small. There were many computers and there was even a second floor. Area 3... ...Ye Qiu saw the Area Number on the ceiling. It looked like he didn&rsquo;t need to go up to the second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he counted to Number 47, Ye Qiu became startled. This station had already been taken by a woman. Moreover, she was playing Glory. She was currently in the Arena dueling. Her fierce movements caused the ponytail bunched up high on her head to sway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing towards her, he saw her controlling a Launcher. Ye Qiu blanked. He almost thought that Su MuCheng was sitting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he quickly realized that it wasn&rsquo;t her. Su MuCheng was always gentle and serene. Even during in an intense PK confrontation, she always held a smile.Speaking about her, Ye Qiu sometimes watched as she smiled while causing her opponents to explode into pieces. When she then politely said sorry, he would always inexplicably tremble a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for this girl, her appearance was also beautiful and gentle. But she fumed with rage and devastated her keyboard in an all-out effort making him feel that her appearance from top to bottom was a huge trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Her murderous spirit is too scary. Only what a pity... ...&rdquo; Ye Qiu saw the screen clearly. He saw that this girl was about to be in a terrible situation. As expected, her opponent capitalized on the opportunity as soon as she made a mistake. In two hits, what little life remaining immediately drained all at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;D*MN IT!&rdquo; Ye Qiu heard this girl roar in rage. She slammed the keyboard directly shutting down the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu hesitated on whether he still wanted the station or not. The girl already turned her head glancing at the hesitant Ye Qiu. Furiously getting up, she asked: &ldquo;Computer?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu nodded his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then sit down!&rdquo; The girl had already left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu shook his head at the impatience of ordinary gamers and finally sat down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo was depressed, extremely depressed. She had just dueled 52 times in the Arena, but she hadn&rsquo;t won a single one. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe this was real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo rubbed the &ldquo;Chasing Haze&rdquo; in her pocket. Her account wasn&rsquo;t bad. Among ordinary players, her account would be considered quite strong and her skill level wasn&rsquo;t low. She had played Glory for a full five years. Her opponent&rsquo;s account wasn&rsquo;t as good as hers, but she still couldn&rsquo;t win over him a single time over 52 duels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a powerful expert.&rdquo; Chen Guo concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Boss, you haven&rsquo;t logged out yet. Why is that person playing?&rdquo; Chen Guo was thinking as she walked, when a voice suddenly interrupted. Chen Guo tilted her head and looked. At the neighboring computer, a frequent customer at the Internet Cafe was stretching out his neck looking at the computer she had just sat at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not good! Chen Guo&rsquo;s heart dropped as she rushed back. Due to Glory&rsquo;s popularity, Glory log-in devices became standard computer accessories that were indispensable for Internet Cafes. Account cards only needed to be inserted into the device so in these sort of public places, everyone put away their cards after using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every card only had one account. Lost cards could be reported, so stealing did not exist. But in these sort of public places, frequently, people would carelessly forget to log-out and end up having their money and equipment looted. Chen Guo had been extremely frustrated after 52 straight losses and wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. She hadn&rsquo;t logged out, but switched to the desktop instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo hurriedly ran up and sure enough, that guy really was playing on her account. Only it didn&rsquo;t look like he was stealing equipment, it looked like he was eagerly dueling in the Arena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo didn&rsquo;t have time to bellow in rage, when a single large word popped up on the screen...</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:20:35', '2025-04-15 18:20:35'),
(55, 20, 'Chapter 3 – Special Duty: Night Shift', 'chapter-3-special-duty-night-shift', '<p>Chapter 3 &ndash; Special Duty: Night Shift</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Win?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo was dumbfounded for a moment. The word that flashed on the screen, Glory, was the Arena&rsquo;s victory symbol meaning &ldquo;K.O.&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only, she had only left for how long? 40 seconds? 50 seconds? Chen Guo lifted her wrist and looked down at her watch. It definitely hasn&rsquo;t been a minute yet. But the result? The opponent I had lost to 52 times in a row was defeated in less than a minute?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo even forgot to rush up and snatch back her account. She wanted to see if this person could duel again for her to examine properly. But in the end, she saw that the person had already logged-out of the game. He stretched out his arms as if he weren&rsquo;t too interested in the computer and glanced around left and right. Turning his head, he saw Chen Guo looking at him with wide eyes and hurriedly explained: &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t logged out yet and when I sat down, the fight had already started. Don&rsquo;t worry, I helped you win!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How long have you used it?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;40 seconds!&rdquo; Ye Qiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo&rsquo;s mouth dropped open when he said somewhat regretfully: &ldquo;My hands were frozen cold or else 30 seconds would&rsquo;ve been enough.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>30 seconds... ... 30 seconds to beat the opponent that I lost to 52 times in a row? Who is this person?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be a professional gamer from the Excellent Era Team? Chen Guo suddenly thought. She knew that the Excellent Era Club wasn&rsquo;t too far away from the Internet Cafe . But she thought again. I would have recognized him if he was from the Excellent Era Team! Unless it&rsquo;s that expert that never shows his face Ye Qiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Qiu! Chen Guo became excited as soon as she thought of the name, but thinking how low-profile this expert was, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t admit to it if she asked him directly. After hesitating for a bit, Chen Guo suddenly thought of something and quickly ran back to the reception desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who registered as Area 3 Number 47&rsquo;s guest?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked the girl at the counter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ye Xiu.&rdquo; the girl said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ye Xiu... ... Ye Qiu? It really is him!&rdquo; Chen Guo excitedly thought. It looked like she really had uncovered his hidden identity! This showed that he really was Ye Qiu. If she had seen the name Ye Qiu written, then she wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Heh heh heh... ...&rdquo; Chen Guo&rsquo;s laugh could only be called sinister. She had been prepared to use everything she owned to get his signature. Ye Qiu&rsquo;s signature, ah! Who had it? No one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as she was thinking this, the receptionist girl said without thinking: &ldquo;He even forgot his ID card.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;ID card?&rdquo; Chen Guo stared blankly after hearing this. Only then did she realize that she had turned silly from excitement. Internet Cafe registration had a system for identifying customers. An ID card had to be shown. How could someone use a fake ID?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where is it? Let me take a look.&rdquo; Chen Guo looked at the ID card in the girl&rsquo;s hand. Sure enough, Ye Xiu was written on it. A wave of disappointment washed over and she a strong urge to change the word Xiu into Qiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finding out that he wasn&rsquo;t the low-profile expert she admired, although she was curious about this person&rsquo;s strength, her interest had already largely disappeared. Chen Guo angrily returned to Area 3 Number 47 and handed over Ye Xiu&rsquo;s ID card: &ldquo;You forgot to take your ID card.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks.&rdquo; Ye Xiu immediately answered, &ldquo;Do you work in the Internet Cafe?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m the boss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh? The boss, that&rsquo;s good. I just saw on the Internet Cafe&rsquo;s homepage, is your Internet Cafe hiring?&rdquo; Ye Xiu asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah... ... yes... ...&rdquo; Chen Guo didn&rsquo;t think that this person would suddenly ask this. She had just been thinking to compare notes with this person. This would be the perfect excuse to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I looked at it and felt that I match all of the qualifications. Work and pay aren&rsquo;t a problem. How about it?&rdquo; Consider it for a moment, boss.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you have to beat me in a duel in Glory.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What? There&rsquo;s this condition?&rdquo; Ye Xiu turned around to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to look for it. I&rsquo;m adding it.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu stared blankly. Only now did he realize that his prior victory was too professional. This beautiful boss was curious about his strength, but... ... Ye Xiu bitterly laughed shaking his head: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t beat you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chen Guo startled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t have an account that can beat yours.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Account... ... what level is it? What equipment?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No levels, no equipment.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Chen Guo didn&rsquo;t believe it. He had defeated the opponent she couldn&rsquo;t beat in 40 seconds. If this type of person didn&rsquo;t have a leveled account, then how did he practice to this level of skill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I gave away my original account.&rdquo; Ye Xiu could only say this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s like this... ... how generous.&rdquo; Chen Guo sighed with sorrow. This person&rsquo;s strength was powerful, his account definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be weak. Powerful accounts were extremely valuable. Gifting it away so easily was very valiant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, too generous.&rdquo; Ye Xiu forced a smile. The account he had given away was the Battle God One Autumn Leaf. To only use the word &ldquo;generous&rdquo; to describe him was truthfully too petty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is it to get ready to play in the new server?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;New server?&rdquo; Ye Xiu stared blankly and suddenly glanced at the date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day was Glory&rsquo;s tenth anniversary. Glory, starting from the second anniversary onwards, would open a new server on every anniversary. The registration for the tenth server had already started three months ago. Old players who weren&rsquo;t satisfied with the old server would prepare to enter Glory again looking forward to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Glory&rsquo;s tenth server was opening. The distant One Autumn Leaf was an account in Glory&rsquo;s first server. Later, in Glory&rsquo;s fifth expansion, a lot of experts obtained the qualifications to complete the Challenge skill becoming the first ones possessing access to all servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now One Autumn Leaf had already exchanged owners. His career as a professional in Glory also left with it, but he coincidentally met up with the start of the new server. Ye Xiu&rsquo;s mind stirred. Ten years of memories suddenly flashed through his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;New server?&rdquo; Ye Xiu mumbled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I remember that at the start of a new server, you can transfer to it right?&rdquo; Ye Xiu suddenly asked Chen Guo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Only Level 1 accounts can.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let me try.&rdquo; Ye Xiu fished out an account card from his pocket and quickly applied for a server transfer on the Glory home page. Chen Guo looked at the account card amazed: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a first-edition card?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Ye Xiu smiled. Glory had a new edition every year. A first-edition card would be from almost ten years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo looked at Ye Xiu astonished: &ldquo;How long have you been playing Glory?&rdquo; Cards weren&rsquo;t living objects. People were. Even if a card had been around for ten years, it didn&rsquo;t mean a person had been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Almost ten years.&rdquo; Ye Xiu answered confirming that he and the card were one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo had thought that she, with five years of gaming, was already considered a veteran. She wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that the guy in front of her had a full double her experience. Ten years. That was Glory&rsquo;s first group of players. To continue playing up until now yet still having interest in entering a new server, what type of drive was this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While thinking this, the home page had already displayed &ldquo;Server Transfer Successful&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo; Ye Xiu pulled out the account card. He once again recalled the little details contained with this first-edition card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you saying you want to become a network manager?&rdquo; Chen Guo suddenly brought up this matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Which one are you looking at?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The night shift one.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you fine with that?&rdquo; Chen Guo surprised. The night shift one went on from 11PM to 7AM. The monthly income was greater than others by three hundred, but very few applied. After all, not many people were willing to have day and night reversed everyday. As a result, everyone had to take turns completing the task. If there truly was someone who took on the special night shift task, then everyone would be relieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No problem, no problem. I like working at night.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo carefully sized up this person in front of her. His hair looked as if it hadn&rsquo;t been taken care of in at least half a month. His face didn&rsquo;t look too healthy. Although it was white and clear, it was that sort of sickly pale. His two eyes gazed at her listlessly. She had seen this appearance many times. The youths that frequently visited her Internet Cafe often look like this. The guy in front of her didn&rsquo;t look too young, but was unexpectedly also so dejected and disdained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disdained was disdained. As long as he wanted to be a full-time night cat, then Chen Guo would welcome him. What&rsquo;s more, she was also curious about the strength of this person with ten years of gaming experience . She clapped her hands on the spot: &ldquo;Okay, then you&rsquo;re hired.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much boss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Look at the terms carefully. It&rsquo;ll be in accordance with those.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then good, come with me!&rdquo; Chen Guo handled matters crisply. After hiring Ye Xiu, she immediately ordered him as an employee to tidy up a pile of keyboards and move them to the second floor for storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo&rsquo;s Internet Cafe was called &ldquo;Happy Internet Club&rdquo;, considered a fairly high-class Internet Cafe. There were two floors and over one thousand computers. The second floor was somewhat small, but was clearly luxurious &mdash; a high-class area. And the inside was a paradise hiding two small inner rooms and storage room. Ye Xiu busily moved keyboards up and down having already inspected this small room. The recruitment page wrote: Food and shelter included. Ye Xiu had just left the club and hadn&rsquo;t yet thought of the next step. Food and shelter, these sort of conditions, would give him time to settle down and think about what to do next. Only then did he feel interested in taking a position at the Internet Cafe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, this small room was probably the &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. Although the decoration was simple, it was clean and tidy. Ye Xiu was very satisfied with it. He continued pondering as he arranged the keyboards that he brought up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll be sleeping.&rdquo; Seeing that Ye Xiu had finished the work, she pointed towards the small bed crammed into the storage room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ye Xiu stared blankly. He imagined that he would be sleeping in that bright and clean room. Even the drawing room sofa would be good. Here... ... Ye Xiu lifted his head to look. On the west wall of the small storage room was a tiny window that directly faced the streetlights. When the storage room lights were closed, dusky light immediately shone through the tiny window as if it were haunted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Eh, it&rsquo;s a little lacking. Just put up with it for now... ... In reality, my Internet Cafe isn&rsquo;t lacking people. With you, we don&rsquo;t have too many. Without you, we don&rsquo;t have too few. The recruitment fliers you saw are a fairly old.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s like this! No problem no problem. This is pretty good.&rdquo; Ye Xiu declared at once. His approving attitude made Chen Guo feel very apologetic. This small storage room truly wasn&rsquo;t a place for living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In your free time, you can go on the computers and play. It&rsquo;s not a problem, employees don&rsquo;t have to pay.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Boss, you&rsquo;re also very generous!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cough, as if I cared about a single computer among a thousand!&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How is the flow of customers ordinarily?&rdquo; Ye Xiu asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not bad. Enough for me to be satisfied.&rdquo; Chen Guo said. &ldquo;Of course, there won&rsquo;t be as many in the night shift. Most of them are students from the nearby university pulling all-nighters. There&rsquo;s really not much to say. You&rsquo;ll see when it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In order for you to adapt to the workplace, how about starting today? I also want to observe and see your ability to work all night.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No problem. My energy&rsquo;s at full capacity.&rdquo; Ye Xiu gave her two big thumbs-up showing that working all night was his specialty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay then. Let&rsquo;s go down. I&rsquo;ll treat you to a midnight snack.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh? To eat what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much at this time. There should be a small restaurant nearby that hasn&rsquo;t closed yet. Go look and buy a few dishes to bring back. I don&rsquo;t eat celery.&rdquo; Chen Guo said as she fished out two hundred dollars from her pocket and slipped them to Ye Xiu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing though!&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just across the road. How much snow would get on you? Hurry up.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu had no other choice. He crossed the road and bought a few midnight snacks. He had just been hired but had already been ordered in quick succession. But he wasn&rsquo;t feeling depressed at all. After speaking with her for only a bit, they were no longer strangers. This sort of natural friendliness made him feel comfortable. Ye Xiu suddenly realized. Even after all this, he had never asked for his boss&rsquo;s name.</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 18:21:08', '2025-04-15 18:21:08');

The smell of the dishes recklessly filled the Internet Cafe immediately causing a wave of wailing and protests from the guests. The time for dinner had already passed yet they were being forced to smell the sweet fragrance from the dishes. That wasn&rsquo;t pleasure. That was a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Line up orderly if you want instant noodles.&rdquo; Chen Guo called out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sister Chen should eat kitchen food everyday. We&rsquo;ll eat instant noodles then.&rdquo; No one rejected the temptation. They could only grab Internet Cafe instant noodles and eat while jealously watching the employees eat their full course meals of six dishes and a soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you also want to go out and eat, don&rsquo;t ask my employees to go on an errand for you.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Next time, could you tell us in advance? Can&rsquo;t you help deliver it to us?&rdquo; A person said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Internet Cafe only has so many people. How could we deliver it all back? Enough of this nonsense, if you really want to eat so much but are too lazy to buy it, go ask for their phone number. Wouldn&rsquo;t they be willing to deliver it?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sister Chen do you have their number? Lend it to me so I can copy it down.&rdquo; A person said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What would I do with their phone number? I have people to run errands for me. Why would I inconvenience the restaurant?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, not only the Cafe guests, but the employees cried together until their cheeks streamed with tears. Ye Xiu found an opportunity and took advantage of it to ask: &ldquo;Boss is surnamed Chen right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yup, Chen Guo. I&rsquo;ve seen your ID card. You&rsquo;re not as old as I am, so I don&rsquo;t mind you calling me sister. You also won&rsquo;t lose out.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want... ...&rdquo; Ye Xiu forced a smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s shredded meat with chili sauce is so spicy. Little brat, go eat it all.&rdquo; Chen Guo hadn&rsquo;t eaten much. She only ate a mouthful before throwing away her chopsticks and rushing to the drinking water. After carrying a glass of water back, she kicked Ye Xiu&rsquo;s stool: &ldquo;Are you done yet? Hurry up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rush?&rdquo; Ye Xiu asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time.&rdquo; Chen Guo lifted her wrist to let Ye Xiu see her watch. It was currently 11:53 PM. There were only 7 minutes until the opening of Glory&rsquo;s tenth server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also going?&rdquo; Ye Xiu was a little surprised. After playing Chen Guo&rsquo;s account Chasing Haze, a fifth sever account, if it had started on the opening of the server, then it would now be a full five years old. Of course, although that account couldn&rsquo;t compare with his professional peak level account, it was still quite good among ordinary players. It wasn&rsquo;t that easy to just simply give it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Take a look at the excitement.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening of a new server really was quite exciting. What had originally been an ordinary day became a time when Happy Internet Cafe exploded with business. The area was packed with players. As far as the eye could see, all of the people had already opened up the registration interface waiting with their mice hovering over the still gray tenth server icon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering the server, players rushed to get on the leaderboards, to clear the first dungeon, to be the first to kill a boss, etc. There were too many things waiting for the players. The opening of a new land caused people&rsquo;s hearts to bounce in excitement. Chen Guo looked towards these guests and couldn&rsquo;t help but be aroused by this sort of atmosphere. She looked back at Ye Xiu, who was still picking his food. She was that he was unexpectedly unaffected by this sort of atmosphere, lacking that inner pioneering quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well what are you waiting for?&rdquo; Chen Guo looked as if she were more anxious than the guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rush?&rdquo; Ye Xiu truly was calm; he wasn&rsquo;t faking it. But he couldn&rsquo;t deny Glory&rsquo;s successful marketing. Glory&rsquo;s competitiveness among players ranked high in every category. These relied on genuine skill which couldn&rsquo;t be casually made up with money and luck. Only, to a famed veteran who had once bathed in glory, these things were only ordinary and mediocre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only after seeing how Chen Guo&rsquo;s expression was filled with murderous intent, did Ye Xiu begin considering that it was worth it to give the boss some face. Finally, he reluctantly put down his rice bowl and looked for a computer station to sit at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;F*ck, it looks like I&rsquo;m forcing him play. What type of person is this?&rdquo; Chen Guo berated Ye Xiu behind his back. The employees all suppressed a laugh. They discovered that this network manager was little different. To be able to casually make their big boss go into a bad temper, this wasn&rsquo;t something an ordinary person could do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo sat at the station beside Ye Xiu and registered her Chasing Haze account. The popularity of the other nine servers hadn&rsquo;t dropped much because of the opening of the tenth server. The older the server the more this was true. This was because starting in Glory with a new account wasn&rsquo;t easy. Chen Guo had played on Chasing Haze for five years until it was considered a fairly good account by ordinary standards. How could it be abandoned so easily? What&rsquo;s more, later, everyone would try to rush to the cross-server Heavenly Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Heavenly Domain wasn&rsquo;t a single map. It was another world. The map was as big as the combined worlds of five other servers. This place had difficult instance dungeons, powerful equipment, precious materials, and also freedom. All experts would meet up there. The Heavenly Domain was a player&rsquo;s final destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was about to be midnight. In the final ten seconds, the Internet Cafe had people who couldn&rsquo;t help but begin to countdown. As the sounds grew louder and louder and the final &ldquo;ZERO&rdquo; erupted, the dull gray color of the tenth server login window faded away. Everyone in the Internet Cafe united into one. They collectively extended their hands and inserted their account cards into the login device. Their mice clicked on the tenth server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Guo turned his head towards Ye Xiu and nearly spurt out blood. While everyone entered the game, this guy leisurely opened up a web page to look at. Raising her eyebrows, she saw that it was some sort of beginner handguide on the sequence of missions to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;F*ck, you don&rsquo;t even know how to do this? You even need a guide?&rdquo; If it wasn&rsquo;t for that genuine first-edition card, even if she were beaten to death, she wouldn&rsquo;t have believed this guy had ten years of gaming experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done this in so long, there&rsquo;s no way I could remember!&rdquo; Ye Xiu slowly and unhurriedly said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never helped someone do it before?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This type of experience... ... I really don&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No sense of community.&rdquo; Chen Guo disdained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had no time.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People with no time wouldn&rsquo;t come to play. Gamers are people with spare time.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was busy playing games.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s your job?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Playing games!&rdquo; Ye Xiu exclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you a professional gamer?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu laughed: &ldquo;I was a pretty high level one too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A pretty high level one? Pro-gamer?&rdquo; Chen Guo stared blankly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu proudly nodded his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve retired!&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Obvious, you&rsquo;re already so old.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu bitterly laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was wondering how you were able to beat that guy in 40 seconds. It turned out you were a professional even if you&rsquo;re an amateur.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Amateur?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know all of the professional experts. Ye Xiu? I&rsquo;ve never heard of the name. If you&rsquo;re not an amateur, what are you?&rdquo; Chen Guo asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, so it&rsquo;s like this.&rdquo; Ye Xiu laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fake it. You actually haven&rsquo;t retired. It&rsquo;s just that you were unable to win a seat, so you were kicked out right?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu was speechless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No offense... ...&rdquo; Chen Guo realized that her words had somewhat stabbed at his sore spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Ye Xiu let out a sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. 25 years old isn&rsquo;t that old. If you keep practicing, maybe you can fight your way back.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I plan on doing.&rdquo; Ye Xiu smiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If that day really happens, then I need to request something from you.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Signature.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why wait until that day? I&rsquo;ll sign it now!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How shameless! Who wants your signature? I only want you to ask for my idols&rsquo; signatures.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh? Who?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Su MuCheng and also Ye Qiu. Ye Qiu might be a little difficult. That person likes to hide.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh so it&rsquo;s like this?&rdquo; Tears streamed down Ye Xiu&rsquo;s cheeks. Ye Qiu was currently chatting with you face to face, sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yup. Only he almost never appears in public. Even if you&rsquo;re an amateur, I didn&rsquo;t know you were this out of touch. You didn&rsquo;t even know about this?&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know. Of course I know. Let me tell you a secret. Actually, I&rsquo;m Ye Qiu.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Really? Then let me tell you a secret too. Actually, I&rsquo;m Su MuCheng.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I really am Ye Qiu.&rdquo; Ye Xiu cried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I really am Su MuCheng.&rdquo; Chen Guo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I... ...&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, stop playing around. Let me see your plan!&rdquo; Chen Guo waved her hand. She would no longer get angry at Ye Xiu&rsquo;s slow and unhurried attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after her line of sight returned to the screen, Chen Guo still couldn&rsquo;t help but say: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand something clearly, you can just ask me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I want to research a bit first. I&rsquo;ll only do missions for attributes or skills. Other missions with rewards such as experience or equipment, it&rsquo;s faster to go to instance dungeons.&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right. This is the type of thinking a veteran should have. Only, you don&rsquo;t need to research it by yourself. Flip to the last page of that guide!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; when Ye Xiu flipped to the last page and looked, a sudden wave of shame hit. Thinking about it, this hand guide hadn&rsquo;t changed much over ten years. This was something players couldn&rsquo;t update any further. For missions that veterans would choose, how could noone have come up with this type of strategy already? Right now, he needed this type of strategy. Just as Ye Xiu was ready to follow this strategy to take missions, tears immediately began streaming down his face. He was once regarded as textbook level figure! Now with a beginners guide in his hands, how could he endure this shame?</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 18:21:43', '2025-04-15 18:21:43'),
(57, 20, 'Chapter 5 – Skill Match', 'chapter-5-skill-match', '<p>Chapter 5 &ndash; Skill Match</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road to receiving quests was a bumpy one. There was heavy traffic on the opening of a new server. In the history of Glory, when the second server opened, the incoming players exceeded the limit in the beginning village causing all the players to freeze. The people who had not logged on also couldn&rsquo;t get online. From then on, on the opening of the server, Glory would temporarily increase the server limit in the village. The disaster that was the opening of the second server never happened again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time&rsquo;s preparation for the opening of the tenth server was sufficient. The entering players were divided equally into every village. Although players could be seen as far as the eye could see, it wasn&rsquo;t packed enough to be a problem. But receiving quests from a NPC was a different problem. Everyone looked for the single NPC to accept quests from and in a short moment, they had crammed together into a lump around him. Glory wouldn&rsquo;t let bodies overlap or pass through others thus people formed ring after ring. The ones inside couldn&rsquo;t come out and the one outside couldn&rsquo;t come in. Many players were bouncing up and down energetically trying to pass over by going above other people&rsquo;s heads. But at this point everyone was still level 0. Their jumping abilities were too poor and there was no way they could jump high enough. Everyone repeatedly bouncing up and down was truly a cute and beautiful scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this situation, even the experts were helpless. Aside, Chen Guo was actually overjoyed with a face of &ldquo;I knew it would be like this&rdquo;. She looked at Ye Xiu and recorded his username: Lord Grim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the constant shouting made by countless players, the situation slowly improved. How was it solved? They made way for a small exit path to let the players who had finished accepting a quest come out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu commanded Lord Grim to take a few quests and began completing them one by one. Most of them were to let the players adapt to the controls and environment. The quests were all educational ones. Ye Xiu was certainly not that bad as to need such advice. After experiencing kill stealing, lining up, squeezing, etc. anyways the ones that were all people created problems, all of the quests that could be finished in the first wave were finished. Chen Guo also observed this process from time to time. Finally, these extremely simple quests unexpectedly took a full two hours causing even Ye Xiu to helplessly sigh with sorrow: What&rsquo;s the point of an expert? In the vast ocean of people, experts didn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Finally done, I&rsquo;m now Level 7.&rdquo; After turning in the last quest, he had leveled up again. He turned around to Chen Guo saying this, but found that boss Chen had already fallen asleep. Yet her head still faced the screen!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does she still need to test my ability to stay up all night? Ye Xiu looked down and threw his jacket onto Chen Guo&rsquo;s body. He turned around and went back to his playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the panel, after completing the first wave of quests, Lord Grim already possessed 340 skill points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Glory, learning and upgrading skills required skill points. Different skills required anywhere from 10 to 50 points. Currently, if a max level, level 70, character finished all of the necessary quests, then it can have up to 4000 skill points. But this wasn&rsquo;t the limit. The skill point limit was 5000 but the remaining 1000 skill points required a certain amount of luck and strength to obtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ten years of Glory, not a single account possessed 5000 skill points. Even the famous Battle God One Autumn Leaf peak account only reached 4840 points, still 160 points away. 160 points wasn&rsquo;t a lot but it wasn&rsquo;t few either. If a player used all of those points on a 50 point ultimate skill, then he could learn three of them or upgrade an ultimate three times. For a peak level expert, this was a huge advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore when taking these beginner quests, quests with experience and equipment rewards could be ignored but skill points were a must. Apart from this, those that rewarded attribute points were important too. Glory characters had four basic attributes: Strength, intelligence, vitality, and spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength affected physical attack, defense, and increased maximum inventory weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intelligence affected magic attacks, defense, and MP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitality naturally affected HP as well as stamina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit affected the resistance to and duration of status effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four main attributes naturally grew as the character leveled. Only after level 20, when players began changing classes, did the growth rate change. As for quests with attribute point rewards, those were fair game. Strength was strength. Intelligence was intelligence. For classes specialized in strength, you could choose to only do strength quests, but quests rewarding intelligence were also open to complete too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was also saying, if after growing as a specialized class, with a max level account that had finished all of the quests, the four main attributes would be at the exact same level. Therefore all these quests should all be completed. Afterwards, equipment could be used to raise the necessary attribute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, attribute points could not be ignored. After looking at the panel, he immediately let Lord Grim learn skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Glory, players can do a class change at level 20. Before then, there was no class and any skills from any profession could be learned as long as there were enough skill points. This was also for the convenience of the players. After advancing to level 20 and finding an interesting class, all of the points learned before would be returned. But after changing classes, a player can only learn from his own class&rsquo;s skills. He cannot become a jack of all trades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Ye Xiu had forgotten what quests to do and how to beat certain instance dungeons, his skills would never be lost. Glory was very balanced. Low-leveled skills also had their own function. Every person could assemble their own skill set however they liked. Though, the amount of skill points was limited. Under normal circumstances, 4000 skill points was nowhere near enough to max out all of the skills. 5000 points was also not enough so players needed to choose carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to choosing skills, Ye Xiu naturally had his own set. Although his One Autumn Leaf&rsquo;s class was a Battle Mage, he himself had once been regarded as a textbook. How could he have only been able to play a single class? Inevitably, only those proficient with every class had the qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu almost without thinking, first went to the beginner skill tree and learned two level 5 beginner skills: Swift Run, Roll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beginner skill tree was something every class could learn skills from. The two skills Ye Xiu had learned were very convenient. These 10 skill points would let the character to move in two different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swift Run increased running speed. The skill had no cooldown but used up stamina. After the stamina was depleted, the player would return to normal walking speed. To recover stamina, a player had to either walk or stand still. Walking would recover it slowly, while standing still would be a bit faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll, as the name implies, lets the character execute a rolling movement. Rolling forward, rolling backwards, rolling left, rolling right, rolling slanted, rolling walking, rolling running, rolling whatever. It also had no cooldown but used up some time to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye Xiu had mastered these two skills long ago. He also clearly knew which skills were practical to him at this stage of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First was Sky Strike, a Battle Mage skill. Every class had this type of knock-up skill. Their characteristics were all the same. After attacking, the target would be knocked up. The higher the skill level, the higher they would knocked up and the greater the damage. This was a commonly used skill. Ye Xiu had originally been a Battle Mage, so he chose the Battle Mage skill Sky Strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, Dragon Tooth, another Battle Mage skill. It was a direct attack that would cause the enemy to be stunned. Ye Xiu also easily learned it because of his original class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then learned the Sharpshooter skill Floating Bullet, the Mechanic skill Machine Trace, the Spellblade skill Wave Splitting Sword, the Grappler skill Backdrop, the Ninja skill Shuriken, the Blade Master skill Guard, the Elementalist skill Electric Ring, and the Priest skill Heal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These skills didn&rsquo;t require a lot of points. They were all within 20 points. Lord Grim was also only level 7, so the number of upgrades he could make to skills were limited. So in the end, there were still some leftover points. Ye Xiu didn&rsquo;t learn any more skills. To him, he already had enough to deal with any situation at his level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if this skill set that had been picked by peak-level expert like him was seen by ordinary players, they would definitely laugh.</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 18:22:06', '2025-04-15 18:22:06'),

This season, we&#39;ll continue to make use of Fang&#39;s strengths,&quot; Henry pointed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I did pass plenty of times to Fang,&quot; Jackson defended. &quot;The Eagles&#39; Power Forward was just too good last season.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muttering to himself, Kaiden asserted, &quot;You lost because you weren&#39;t playing as a team.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henry, this year&#39;s team captain, caught wind of Kaiden&#39;s comment and turned to him with a stern expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What did you just say, waterboy?&quot; he demanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s eyebrows raised in surprise, and he found himself stumbling on his words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He says we weren&#39;t playing as a team,&quot; Fang Liu calmly said, throwing Kaiden a nonchalant look. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, waterboy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden hesitated but then took a deep breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think the reason why you guys lost last season was because of the lack of coordination and communication in the team. The ball movement was slow, and you guys missed opportunities to set up plays since you were too focused on passing it to Fang. Sometimes, it&#39;s not just about individual skills&mdash;especially since you&#39;re playing against a team that has Zheng Zhang.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, are you saying we can&#39;t handle Zheng Zhang with our individual skills?&quot; Fang asked with a disbelieving smirk on his lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant&mdash;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s statement was cut off when Henry threw a ball over his way, hitting him square on the head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Such a know-it-all,&quot; Henry scoffed. &quot;Just go home and train, kid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Train?&quot; Jackson, the team&#39;s center, chuckled. &quot;He can&#39;t even walk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, the team burst into laughter, causing Kaiden to purse his lips and cast his gaze to his lap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Go home, waterboy. You&#39;re not needed in this practice,&quot; Fang calmly said, dribbling before shooting the ball from the three-point line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He makes it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden shook his head in disappointment as he wheeled himself out of the gymnasium&#39;s exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, before he reached outside, he turned around and cleared his throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s Kaiden,&quot; he courageously said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The players halted, casting him weird glances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What are you talking about, waterboy?&quot; Henry asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My name&#39;s Kaiden. It&#39;s not waterboy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, he finally left the gymnasium to go back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hailed a bus and got in, receiving pitiful looks from the people inside. Kaiden ignored them and wheeled himself to the very back, gazing out of the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden smiled softly as he watched the passing scenery. He caught a glimpse of the city&#39;s public basketball court, and his smile widened when he recalled his memories of the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years ago, Kaiden&#39;s dream of becoming a basketball player flourished on that very court. His mother, a single parent, fueled his passion by bringing him to games and giving him everything he needed to pursue his goal despite their low status in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, tragedy struck when Kaiden lost his mother in a devastating accident that not only took away the person he loved the most but also robbed him of his ability to walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, under the care of his aunt and her overbearing son, Kaiden found himself confined to a small room in their house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His aunt, preoccupied with running a chicken place, insisted that Kaiden work for her. The once vibrant dream of playing basketball had crumbled into the harsh reality of his new life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his love for the game, Kaiden was relegated to the sidelines, not just on the court but in the broader scope of his own existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he passed by the court, memories flooded back&mdash;of his mother&#39;s laughter, the sound of bouncing basketballs, and the echo of his dreams before tragedy struck. Yet, Kaiden&#39;s spirit remained unbroken. He clung to the hope that one day, he could contribute to the game he loved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, his thoughts snapped back to reality when he saw the familiar neighborhood. He pressed the stop button before wheeling to the front and getting off the bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden still had to pass by the dark and narrow pathway of his neighborhood before he arrived at their small, beat-down house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah, there he is!&quot; the sound of his aunt&#39;s obnoxious voice greeted him as he arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden frowned when he saw a bunch of unfamiliar men who reeked of alcohol and cigarettes standing outside of their house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Make it faster,&quot; Rui, her son, urged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Take his wheelchair as collateral. I promise I&#39;ll pay you back at the end of the month. I just bought some raw materials for the shop, so I don&#39;t have enough money right now,&quot; his aunt said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Kaiden asked, still perplexed about the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, one of the men inspected his wheelchair before scoffing in disbelief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You want us to take this rusty old thing? Pay up, old lady. We don&#39;t have all day,&quot; he urged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have any money,&quot; Rui said, crossing his arms in front of his chest. &quot;If you want, you can take this disabled cousin of mine. He can do your dirty work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group of men stared at Kaiden with narrowed eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You want us to take a broken wheelchair, and now you even want us to take a broken person? Don&#39;t joke around. We already gave you plenty of chances. This is the last time we&#39;d be asking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s frown deepened as he finally recognized who these men were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were the people her aunt borrowed money from to pay for Rui&#39;s tuition fee. When Rui found that Kaiden got accepted into Huolan high, he also insisted on studying in the prestigious school. However, he wasn&#39;t very good in his academics and was mediocre in sports and art. In the end, they borrowed money from loan sharks to pay for his tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m tired of this,&quot; one of the men suddenly said, bringing out something from his back pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His aunt shrieked in horror while Rui&#39;s eyes widened in shock. The spoiled teen took cover behind Kaiden&#39;s wheelchair, pinning him in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Kaiden exclaimed, trying to escape but to no avail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s when it hit him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man was pointing a gun toward his way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Bang*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...and that&#39;s when it really hit him.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:25:41', '2025-04-15 18:25:41'),

Despite the pain in his body, he sat up, much to the astonishment of the three unfamiliar figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s gaze scanned the scene, revealing a person with bloody knuckles and another clutching a bloodied bat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were these the loan sharks who shot him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If so, then they looked very young to be in the lending industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe his aunt and cousin really sold him off?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He mustered the strength to croak out a single question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked, his voice deep yet strained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trio stood frozen, surprise and uncertainty seen on their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seconds stretched, thick with tension, before one of them stammered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;H&mdash;how are you awake?&quot; he asked. &quot;What the hell, Yuan? You said you&#39;d finish the job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I made sure to hit him really hard! Look, his head is still bleeding!&quot; Yuan defended. &quot;It&#39;s Hui who didn&#39;t do his job well,&quot; he pointed to the guy with bloodied brass knuckles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden assessed the situation. These boys looked very young, only around the same age as him. He couldn&#39;t fully see the face of the loan shark who shot him but he was certain he wasn&#39;t one of the three people before him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden looked down at his body and saw bruises and cuts all over his skin. He also reached for his aching head and found it was covered in deep red blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Did you do this to me?&quot; he asked, looking up at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three felt chills run down their spine. However, Yuan quickly mustered up his courage and answered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t act innocent, Kai. We wouldn&#39;t have done this if you didn&#39;t seduce Jinping&#39;s girlfriend,&quot; he spat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guy, who Kaiden assumed to be Jinping, glared at him with profound hatred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s frown deepened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Kaiden innocently asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steal his girlfriend?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden was lucky if a girl even willingly talked to him!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is annoying,&quot; Jinping said. &quot;You stole my girlfriend, humiliated me in front of my friends, and now you&#39;re acting like you didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Hand me the bat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuan passed Jinping the bat, and the latter quickly aimed to hit Kaiden&#39;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, before it could land on Kaiden&#39;s shoulder, he quickly caught it with his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s eyes widened, surprised with his reflexes and strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look, I think you have the wrong guy,&quot; he calmly said. &quot;I need to go back to my family so I can help with cleaning up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since when did you care about your family?&quot; Jinping asked. &quot;Stop acting innocent and tell my girlfriend to come back to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jinping tried to swing the bat once more, but Kaiden held on tighter, making it immovable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he pulled it away from Jinping&#39;s hold, making the latter stumble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jinping cursed under his breath and aimed to punch Kaiden&#39;s face. However, Kaiden quickly stood to evade his attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His eyes comically widened as he looked down at his legs.

He even slapped himself with his bloody palms to determine if he was dreaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It hurts. It&#39;s not a dream,&quot; he muttered, holding onto his cheek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, chuckles bubbled up before they turned into full-blown laughter. He was still holding onto the bat, happily swinging it around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rain started falling harder, and the distant rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning accompanied his manic laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trio exchanged bewildered glances, their initial objective shattered by the scene before them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m scared,&quot; Hui said, taking a step back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we messed with the wrong guy,&#39;&quot; Yuan gulped, also wanting to go home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jinping tried to keep a brave facade as he shakily stepped forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s&mdash;let&#39;s beat him up again,&quot; he stammered. &quot;There&#39;s only one of him and three of us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; Hui whispered. &quot;He is the &#39;Mad Dog&#39; after all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jinping pursed his lips and finally swallowed his pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fine, let&#39;s go,&quot; he said. &quot;But this isn&#39;t over yet!&quot; he shouted, glaring at the insane-looking guy frolicking under the rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They walked away from the scene.

It&#39;s even a wonder how you&#39;re still standing with all your injuries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Right?&quot; Kaiden beamed. &quot;It&#39;s unbelievable how I&#39;m standing right now. It&#39;s a miracle!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang and Wang looked at each other before sighing in unison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, a worried woman&#39;s voice was heard inside the station, causing all of them to turn toward the entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kai!

Gosh, how did you end up as my grandson?&quot; she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, there seemed to be quite a lot of idiotic men inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden frowned, feeling more confused than he already was. Didn&#39;t his mom say her parents died before he was even born?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old woman sat next to Kaiden and bowed her head in front of the police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I apologize once more for my grandsons&#39; actions, officers,&quot; she humbly said, even going as far as kneeling on the cold, dirty floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden&#39;s eyes widened, and he quickly assisted her to go back to her seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize for your grandson&#39;s actions, Grandma Bingbing,&quot; Officer Wang said, looking pitifully at the old lady.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But he is my responsibility,&quot; Grandma Bingbing said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We only need some information about the incident.

I didn&#39;t even fight with those guys.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Didn&#39;t fight?&quot; Officer Huang scoffed. &quot;Look at yourself,&quot; he said, turning the small mirror on the table toward Kaiden&#39;s way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden glanced at the mirror; then he exclaimed loudly as he caught a glimpse of the boy staring back at him. He was so shocked that he fell off his chair, causing Grandma Bingbing and the officers to look at him with concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Who&mdash;Who is that?&quot; he asked, stunned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiden wasn&#39;t too fond of looking at himself in the mirror.

Otherwise, I really think you would be kicked out again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai couldn&#39;t internalize Grandma Bingbing&#39;s words because the holographic interface appeared before him again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Name: Kai Gou</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age: 16</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Height: 189 cm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level: Noob (0/100)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skills: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Are you even listening?&quot; Grandma Bingbing sighed, snapping Kai out of his thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kai quickly said, looking at the old lady with an apologetic gaze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grandma Bingbing froze, looking at her grandson with wide eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was it just her, or did her idiotic grandson apologize?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She pinched her palm and shook her head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re definitely not alright,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Go and take a bath so you can sleep.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, Grandma Bingbing left Kai all alone in the living room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai, albeit confused, stood from the chair and entered what seemed to be his room. It wasn&#39;t really difficult to decipher that it was his. There was some vandal writing on the door, and the walls were covered with photos of weapons and cool anime girls dressed in robot costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He opened the closet doors and found clothes he wouldn&#39;t even think of wearing. Then, his eyes caught a glimpse of a red towel, so he quickly grabbed it and made his way to the bathroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, he saw warm water in a basin, causing him to smile. Grandma Bingbing must have prepared it for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai started removing his clothes but stopped when he felt a phone inside the pocket of his shorts. He brought it out and was surprised to see it didn&#39;t have a password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, he saw the date and time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3, 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the same day. Then, he saw the location on the phone&#39;s top bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jilin City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was more than 1,000 kilometers and 10 hours away from Beijing, his hometown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There could only be one plausible explanation for what was happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transmigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Review user history?]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Yes or No?]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Kai muttered, and the screen displayed text containing information about the original person&#39;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Kai Gou, also known as &#39;Mad Dog,&#39; gained notoriety in town as a troublemaker following the tragic demise of his father.

(63, 22, 'Chapter 1: Mo Hua', 'chapter-1-mo-hua', '<p>In the year 20,022 of the Dao Calendar, on the tenth day of September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tongxian City, outside the gates of Tongxian Sect, on a mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten-year-old Mo Hua, wearing the plain robe of an outer sect disciple, squatted uninterestedly behind a huge rock at the base of the mountain, holding a piece of grass root and intently drawing complex patterns on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the hour of Mao, disciples from the sect who came to learn gradually made their way up the mountain, in groups of twos and threes, chatting and laughing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chubby boy dressed in the standard outer sect robe, adorned with precious jade ornaments and with a round, small-eyed face, accompanied by two or three attendants, found Mo Hua behind the rock, contentedly drawing something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chubby boy looked around left and right, and seeing no mentors from the sect around, he cautiously called out:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mo Hua!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua looked up, his handsome face as picturesque as a painting, his eyes clear as if scooping up a pond of crystal water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chubby boy lowered his voice and asked, &quot;Is it done?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ten-year-old Mo Hua, behaving beyond his years, patted his chest, &quot;I handle things, you just relax,&quot; and then took out several arrays from the storage bag behind him&mdash;white paper and red ink&mdash;and handed them to the chubby boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Check if there&#39;s anything amiss.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chubby boy solemnly took them, opened the copy, glanced at it, and then said with a pained expression:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t understand...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua patiently explained:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The homework assigned by the mentor was the basic patterns of the Five Elements Array. I&#39;ve drawn it for you and purposely made six mistakes to prevent the mentor from realizing that these weren&#39;t drawn by you&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Six mistakes&hellip; isn&#39;t that a bit too many?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua silently looked at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chubby boy soon realized his mistake and reflected:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One shouldn&#39;t be too greedy. It&#39;s already good that I can hand in the homework assigned by the mentor. Doing too well would only arouse suspicion. Once discovered by the mentor, if my father finds out, he&#39;ll surely beat me severely, which would not be worth the loss&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua nodded, &quot;You&#39;re wise, Young Master An, to figure it out so quickly!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chubby boy stuffed two spirit stones into Mo Hua&#39;s hand, &quot;Brother Mo, you have good insight, knowing how clever I am! Here are the spirit stones, I&#39;ll still come to you next time the mentor assigns array homework!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After saying that, he tucked the arrays into his robe and sprinted up the mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua carefully put away the two spirit stones and picked up a new piece of grass root to continue drawing on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after, a thin young master, shaking a gold-sprinkled paper fan, with a sharp and distinguished face and more jade ornaments on his body, approached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua also handed him an array chart. The thin young master glanced at the chart and then signaled to a servant. The servant came forward, took the chart, and handed Mo Hua two spirit stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master took the array chart but did not leave. Suddenly, he closed his fan arrogantly and said, &quot;This young master is also very skilled in array formation, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t have the time to do these basic formations, so I had you write them for me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua, uninterested in engaging further, picked up the grass root and continued drawing on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master, slightly annoyed, then sneered, &quot;It&#39;s said among the early-stage Qi-cultivating disciples of Tongxian Gate, you draw the best arrays. I wonder how you compare to this young master. Maybe we should compete sometime?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua thought to himself, You&#39;re already having me do your array homework, what do you think of your own level?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, adhering to the principle of harmony brings wealth, Mo Hua still lifted his head and picked flattering words:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, the young master&#39;s mastery of array formation is far superior. The Qian family is the leading clan in Tongxian City, and your lineage in array formation is unmatched by other cultivators.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master&#39;s expression slightly brightened, then he asked, &quot;Then tell me, among the early-stage Qi-cultivating disciples of Tongxian Gate, is there anyone whose skill in array formation surpasses mine?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are indeed a few&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master displeased, &quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Like me&hellip;&quot; Of course, Mo Hua wouldn&#39;t foolishly say that out loud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are quite a few, too many to count right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master clearly got angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a good thing!&quot; Mo Hua lied blatantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master sneered, &quot;People whose family</p>\r\n\r\n<p>status isn&#39;t as good as mine, who don&#39;t have as many spirit stones as I do, but whose array skills surpass mine, there are a lot of them, you mean to say I&#39;m stupid and can&#39;t compare to others? How is this a good thing?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua replied, &quot;Think about it, you&#39;re just at the Qi-cultivation stage, yet you have Foundation-building cultivators working for you; you&#39;re just a first-grade array master, yet you have second-grade array masters at your beck and call. How prestigious is that! The stronger the abilities of the cultivators under you, the greater your own skills appear!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master paused, then had a sudden realization, &quot;That does make some sense!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;See?&quot; Mo Hua affirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin young master nodded, looking down at the myriad of cultivators below, his neck held even higher:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly! No matter how talented you are, how hard you practice, in the end, aren&#39;t you still working for my Qian family?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After duping the young master of the Qian family and seeing him off proudly, Mo Hua continued practicing array formation on the ground with his grass root.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, several wealthy cultivators came by, exchanging money for goods, buying several array formations from Mo Hua with spirit stones. By the time Mo Hua&#39;s hand-copied array formations were sold, he had gathered twelve spirit stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve spirit stones were quite a sum for a rogue cultivator, but for cultivation, they were far from enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua sighed, a hint of helplessness on his youthful face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the low-level cultivators, the path of cultivation was bleak&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first year of the Dao Calendar, over twenty thousand years ago, the largest power in the cultivation world&mdash;the Dao Court&mdash;unified the nine provinces of cultivation, enfeoffed noble families and sects, and established a unified rank system to standardize the levels of cultivation professions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dao Court also promulgated the &quot;Dao Laws&quot; to restrict cultivators from wanton killing, looting, and harvesting life essence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to this, the cultivation world developed and prospered for over twenty thousand years, flourishing tremendously, its territory vast, its cultivators countless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet while the Dao Court thrived gloriously, the noble families prospered, and the sects dominated regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the low-level rogue cultivators, with no affiliation, lived in hardship, with no hope for advancement in cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After twenty thousand years of proliferation in the cultivation world, humans without spiritual roots were naturally eliminated, leaving only those with spiritual roots who could cultivate. But as more cultivators arose, the more spiritual energy they consumed, depleting the spiritual energy of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if cultivators wished to advance in cultivation, they needed not only legacy but also spirit stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with large families occupying the spirit mines and major sects monopolizing legacies, ordinary rogue cultivators found no path to cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tongxian City, the vast majority of rogue cultivators, lacking legacy and spirit stones, spent their lives merely at the Qi-cultivation stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qi-cultivation stage, merely the most humble ants under the vast heavenly path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Mo Hua was one of these countless ants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And likely, he would be for life!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua&#39;s youthful face bore a hint of bitterness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heavenly path might be fair, but cultivation, certainly is not&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua, a second-level Qi-cultivating rogue cultivator, was born into a family of Qi-cultivators. His father, Mo Shan, hunted demons for a living, always battling with demonic beasts, his body covered in scars. His mother worked in a kitchen, her lungs frequently pained by the heat and smoke, often coughing painfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His parents scrimped and saved every spirit stone they could just to allow Mo Hua to join the outer sect of the Tongxian Gate for cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no matter how Mo Hua cultivated, with his mediocre spiritual roots&mdash;slightly better than ordinary people but far from the genius rampant in the cultivation world&mdash;he was destined to be just an average member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how much he cultivated, he would likely remain just a Qi-cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the family&#39;s dire conditions and lack of spirit stones, Mo Hua could only cultivate up to the sixth level of Qi-cultivation like the other disciples before leaving the sect to find a trade to make a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Mo Hua was also naturally frail!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crafting of tools and hunting of demons, usual professions for physically strong cultivators, were not suitable for the inherently weak Mo Hua, who might even struggle to find a job to feed himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should he marry and have children in the future, the burden would increase, and all the spirit stones would be used to support his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without spirit stones for cultivation, Mo Hua&#39;s cultivation level would forever stagnate, living his life merely as a Qi-cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like all the impoverished rogue cultivators in Tongxian City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the countless low-level cultivators in the cultivation world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forever just a Qi-cultivator!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ten-year-old Mo Hua sighed, adjusted his mindset, and then entered the sect for classes. After a day of cultivation, Mo Hua returned to the disciples&#39; residence, read some cultivation scriptures, and by the hour of Zi, he lay in bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Mo Hua closed his eyes, a fragmented stele appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stele bore no inscriptions, but from the first glance Mo Hua saw it, he knew the name of the stele:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dao Stele!</p>', 1, '2025-04-15 18:29:33', '2025-04-15 18:29:33'),
(64, 22, 'Chapter 2: The Dao Stele', 'chapter-2-the-dao-stele', '<p>Ever since Mo Hua could remember, a Dao Stele had appeared in his sea of consciousness, accompanied by some fleeting memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those memories, Mo Hua lived a brief life in another world devoid of spiritual energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that life, Mo Hua&#39;s family was ordinary, but he studied diligently, achieved good grades, and was admitted to college, majoring in fine arts, with a passion for studying traditional Chinese painting and calligraphy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduation, he worked in a major company as a graphic designer, often working overtime. He died of overwork in his twenties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His life as a student was spent studying, and after graduation, it was consumed by work, living under constant stress and anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he came to his senses, he realized he had lived a muddled life and died unexpectedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his final moments, his life flashed before his eyes like a reel of film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He realized he hadn&#39;t done anything truly valuable in life: he hadn&#39;t shown filial piety to his parents, hadn&#39;t pursued his dreams, had no love, and hadn&#39;t seen the vast world&#39;s landscapes...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These memories were blurry, and sometimes Mo Hua couldn&#39;t tell if they were real or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly, it was unclear whether it was Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly, or the butterfly dreaming it was Zhuangzi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time passed, Mo Hua stopped worrying about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The past was the past, and now, at the age of ten, he lived in a world of cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he was a cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cultivator who could fully comprehend the heavenly Dao, traverse the nine provinces, pick the sun and moon with one hand, and bury the stars with the other!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, he could be a cultivator who spent his life cultivating Qi, unable to fly, fight, or use many spells, and lived a humble life...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the Dao Stele, Mo Hua guessed he would probably be the latter, humble type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dao Stele floated in Mo Hua&#39;s sea of consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was wide, ancient, and oddly shaped, seemingly insubstantial, yet it seemed to ripple with a profound and mysterious aura. At times, it appeared utterly serene, as if nothing existed at all...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this void-like surface of the stele, one could draw array formations, and each time an array was drawn, Mo Hua&#39;s spiritual sense would strengthen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the world of cultivation, array formations were revered!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning array formations was the most challenging of all cultivation practices, and the most important aspect was spiritual sense!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Array formations consisted of patterns that were the painstaking depictions of the heavenly Dao by ancient cultivators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patterns of the arrays resembled ancient texts or simple drawings, each containing infinite mysteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing an array formation connected one&#39;s sea of consciousness to the secrets of the heavenly Dao, consuming a significant amount of spiritual sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a cultivator&#39;s spiritual sense was insufficient, drawing an array could lead to exhaustion of spiritual sense, and even the shattering of the sea of consciousness, resulting in death. To become an array master, one must continuously study various array patterns and practice various formations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, learning and practicing array formations was difficult, and array masters often died from insufficient spiritual sense due to forcefully drawing arrays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua drew array formations on the Dao Stele, which consumed his spiritual sense, but when he erased the drawn arrays, the spiritual sense was instantly restored, making his spiritual sense abundant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From existence to nonexistence, and then from nonexistence back to existence, it was akin to the great Dao, profoundly mysterious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with each drawing of an array formation, Mo Hua&#39;s spiritual sense increased slightly. Although it was a minor increase, it was indeed an increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as Mo Hua knew, there were no cultivation techniques in the cultivation world specifically for enhancing spiritual sense; increases in spiritual sense mostly depended on breakthroughs in cultivation levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, even a slight increase in spiritual sense was extremely precious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as he kept drawing array formations on the Dao Stele, Mo Hua could improve his skills in array formation, and as long as he continued drawing arrays, his spiritual sense would keep strengthening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a strong spiritual sense, Mo Hua could learn more advanced and powerful array formations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, he could become a powerful array master through this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Array masters held a revered status. Even ordinary array masters who drew arrays for others earned a considerable income in spirit stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once one became an array master and could draw various profound arrays, they had the means to continue cultivating and wouldn&#39;t have to spend their lives just cultivating Qi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua thought quietly to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But becoming an array master was also fraught with difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning arrays and becoming an array master was challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the cultivation categories set by the Dao Court, the recognition of an array master was the strictest and most demanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Array formations were made up of patterns, with the simplest arrays containing only one pattern. Each</p>\r\n\r\n<p>additional pattern raised the array&#39;s level, enhancing its effectiveness and requiring a greater amount of spiritual sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing one to five patterns qualified one as an array apprentice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing six to eight patterns could make one an array master, but such a master was just ordinary and not recognized by the Dao Court&#39;s ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only by drawing nine patterns and passing the Dao Court&#39;s ranking assessment could one become a true first-class array master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming a first-class array master was almost like ascending to heaven for a Qi-cultivating cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first-class array master was essentially a guest of honor in major families and sects. Even foundation-building cultivators dared not offend them easily. Even if they did nothing, they would receive a monthly stipend of spirit stones from the Dao Court&#39;s Tian Shu Pavilion and have countless young and beautiful female cultivators breaking down their doors, vying to become their Dao companions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the extreme difficulty of the assessment, each state also had a quota for becoming a first-class array master. Whether one could become a first-class array master depended both on effort and fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With bad luck, if the quota in one&#39;s state was full, even if one had the skills of a first-class array master, they wouldn&#39;t get a quota in that assessment and would have to wait for the next one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some array masters spent their lives attempting the assessment and wasted their years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countless low-level cultivators exhausted their minds and grew old without ever achieving their lifelong wish to advance to a first-class array master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The so-called quota limitation by the Dao Court was generally just an excuse predetermined by major families and sects. They needed the title of first-class array master to add glory to their direct descendants or direct disciples, making them stand out as geniuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those low-level cultivators who toiled to become first-class array masters were just dust underfoot, never noticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was already night, and Mo Hua lay in the bedroom of the disciple&#39;s residence, his spiritual sense immersed in the sea of consciousness, continuously drawing array formations on the Dao Stele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The array formation Mo Hua was drawing was called the Dual Element Array, which included two patterns and was one of the basic array formations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this array formation was one Mo Hua had never successfully drawn before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early-stage Qi-cultivating disciples, like those in the outer sect of the Tongxian Sect, generally lacked sufficient spiritual sense and could rarely learn an array containing a single pattern in its entirety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Mo Hua had already mastered the single pattern and could draw it effortlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua wanted to learn more challenging array formations, so every night, he practiced the Dual Element Array on the Dao Stele, which included two patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After dozens of nights of repeated practice and persistent effort, Mo Hua finally succeeded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an array master learning array formations, each pattern was a threshold, and drawing an additional pattern was like climbing a step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to draw two patterns meant Mo Hua&#39;s spiritual sense and array mastery were already far superior to his peers in the early Qi-cultivating stage of the outer sect disciples at Tongxian Sect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His array mastery was probably unique among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua breathed a sigh of relief. When the hour of Mao arrived and dawn broke, his spiritual sense left the sea of consciousness, and Mo Hua opened his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite having drawn arrays all night, Mo Hua&#39;s spiritual sense remained clear, and he didn&#39;t feel tired, as if he had just had a restful sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He opened the window, and the morning sunlight shone on his fair and delicate face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rising sun outside the window draped the sky in rosy hues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ten-year-old Mo Hua took a deep breath, gazing at the horizon with a determined look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as he kept practicing array formations and continuously honed his spiritual sense, one day, he would surely become a first-class array master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, like the rising sun, he would take a significant step towards seeking the path of immortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he would no longer be just a Qi cultivator.</p>', 2, '2025-04-15 18:30:02', '2025-04-15 18:30:02'),
(65, 22, 'Chapter 3: The Array Master', 'chapter-3-the-array-master', '<p>Mo Hua woke up at the hour of the Rabbit and started his routine cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An hour later, after concluding his practice, he headed to the classroom to await instruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instructors in the sect are collectively called &quot;educators&quot; and teach Outer Sect disciples various disciplines including cultivation, array formation, pill concoction, and artifact forging, while also supervising and guiding their practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other sects in the cultivation world, the Tongxian Sect also categorizes disciples into three types: direct disciples, Inner Sect, and Outer Sect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Outer Sect is open to the public for the purpose of teaching and cultivating new practitioners, funded by the disciples&#39; entrance fees, which are essentially tuition. Outer Sect disciples learn the publicly available teachings of the sect, and upon graduation or departure, they retain a nominal relationship with the sect but are not materially bound to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Inner Sect is the core of the sect, where disciples are deeply integrated and manage the sect&rsquo;s enterprises such as spirit mines, spirit lands, caves, and commercial operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inner Sect disciples have access to teachings and spells not typically shared outside, bonded by a master-disciple relationship that ties them closely to the sect. Misdeeds by an Inner Sect disciple can implicate the sect, and those who betray their masters are often seen as committing a grave transgression, with severe consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct disciples of the sect are the Inner Sect&rsquo;s elite, either blood-related to the sect leader or elders or having a deep master-disciple relationship. Direct disciples are the core of the sect, often ascending to crucial positions such as sect leader or elder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachings of the direct disciples include the sect&rsquo;s most esoteric doctrines, and if a direct disciple betrays the sect, they are hunted down to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dao Law prohibits vigilante justice and indiscriminate killing. Pursuing a betraying direct disciple goes against these laws and will bring accountability from the Dao Court. However, such matters are typically managed by local Dao Court authorities. The Dao Court, being the most powerful, does not interfere directly in such affairs, especially concerning major sects with significant influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of this concerned Mo Hua much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was just an Outer Sect disciple of the Tongxian Sect, neither of the Inner Sect nor a direct disciple. Even if he wished to be targeted, he was not considered significant enough...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua longed to join the Inner Sect, but without spirit stones or connections, it seemed unlikely in this lifetime, let alone becoming a direct disciple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Settling into his seat, Mo Hua focused his mind until a stern-looking educator, around fifty years old and of the ninth level of Qi cultivation, entered the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Tongxian Sect, this educator held a high position because he alone taught array formations and was rumored to possibly become a ranked Array Master within a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Qi-cultivation phase disciples learned their array formations from him, regardless of their background. He treated all equally; making no exceptions in reprimanding or disciplining those who erred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the disciples both respected and feared him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual tuition was due once a year, hence classes were held annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today was the last day of the sect&#39;s annual training. After today, a month-long break would commence. The disciples&#39; grades for various courses would also be released today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educator held a stack of report cards in his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disciples were anxious. Mo Hua was initially indifferent, but seeing his peers&rsquo; nervousness made him anxious as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, Mo Hua received his grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, he excelled in array formations, earning the highest grade, an &#39;A&#39;. In the Tongxian Sect, not many could achieve such a grade in arrays, and Mo Hua was among the few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His cultivation was rated &#39;B&#39;. It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of effort but because his innate talents were limited. With a mediocre Five Elements spiritual root, his progress was constrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other subjects that could be mastered with time, like the History of Dao or Theories of Qi Cultivation, he also scored &#39;A&#39;s. However, for subjects requiring materials purchased with spirit stones, like pill concoction or talisman making, he scored &#39;B&#39;s and &#39;C&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from a poor family, Mo Hua couldn&rsquo;t even afford a proper alchemy furnace. His grades in these subjects depended mostly on luck and were inconsistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But overall, his performance was commendable. As the saying goes, &quot;one brilliant trait overshadows many flaws.&quot; Excelling in the difficult art of array formations was no small feat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educator spoke briefly before stepping out for a moment. The disciples began whispering and glancing at each other&#39;s grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mo Hua, you got an &#39;A&#39; in arrays again!&quot; a disciple whispered after sneaking a peek at Mo Hua&#39;s report card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Another &#39;A&#39;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I always get a &#39;B&#39;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I got a &#39;C&#39;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Arrays are so hard, my head</p>\r\n\r\n<p>hurts just thinking about them...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disciples gradually crowded around Mo Hua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmph!&quot; a disciple from the Qian family, dressed in a silver-white robe, scoffed unhappily,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&rsquo;s so great about that? It&rsquo;s just the simple arrays of the sect that get you an &#39;A&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What did you get?&quot; another disciple challenged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why should I tell you?&quot; the Qian family disciple retorted disdainfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another disciple sneaked a look at his grades and laughed loudly, &quot;He got a &#39;C&#39;!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The room burst into laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You got a &#39;C&#39; and you&rsquo;re laughing at someone who got an &#39;A&#39;, shameless!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Thicker-faced than a forge!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Even though he&#39;s from the Qian family, he&#39;s dumber than me; I got a &#39;B&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qian family disciple, red-faced with anger, retorted, &quot;What does an &#39;A&#39; matter? Without an Array Master, you rogues understand nothing!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pointing at Mo Hua and the others, he sneered, &quot;You lot, just frogs in a well, without legacy, will never, listen carefully, never produce a real Array Master. If you don&rsquo;t understand, I can repeat it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Rogues never deserve to be Array Masters!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surrounding disciples fell silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua looked at him as if he were foolish, then stood up, bowed respectfully to someone behind the Qian family disciple, and said,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good day, educator!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qian family disciple turned stiffly, realizing the educator was standing right behind him, his face livid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The sect is meant for teaching and cultivation, not for your petty comparisons and slander!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can&rsquo;t even master basic arrays, and yet you have the nerve to mock your peers?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, stand outside as punishment until dusk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Redraw the basic Five Elements Array patterns a hundred times. Show them to me when school resumes next year. If you can&#39;t, don&rsquo;t bother returning...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qian family disciple&rsquo;s face turned ashen, but he dared not utter a word of rebuttal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educator, with high authority, could discipline even the Qian family&#39;s direct descendants, let alone this lesser branch member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qian family disciple sulkily went to stand as punished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educator stood in front of Mo Hua, silent for a moment, then patted his thin shoulders and sighed, &quot;Don&rsquo;t mind what others say, just focus on learning.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua, expression unchanged, respectfully bowed to the educator, &quot;This disciple will heed your words.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educator nodded, then moved to the educator&#39;s seat and gave a few more instructions before announcing the sect&#39;s annual break, allowing everyone to go home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disciples, barely containing their excitement, bowed to the educator, thanking him for a year of guidance in cultivation, then scattered like birds and beasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sect was on break, and the disciples were overjoyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua watched them, his heart heavy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Qi-cultivation period disciples, mostly young and carefree, had no idea of the hardships of a cultivator&#39;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking of his father&#39;s scars from hunting demons and his mother&#39;s worn face, Mo Hua&#39;s heart ached, and he sighed deeply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Becoming a ranked Array Master was still a distant dream, but within his means, he wanted to make life better for his parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his grades in hand and twelve spirit stones in his pocket, Mo Hua left the Tongxian Sect, not heading home but towards the market instead.</p>', 3, '2025-04-15 18:30:30', '2025-04-15 18:30:30');

The stall owner, an elderly man surnamed Sun, known to acquaintances as Old Sun, has a son who works in Wanbao Building. Occasionally, his son gets some substandard goods that Wanbao Building doesn&#39;t want and sells them cheaply to his father for street vending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun, hawking his wares, looks up to see Mo Hua running towards him, his pale face flushed with exertion, and can&#39;t help but tease:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Little brother, what spiritual tool are you here to look at today? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re just looking and not buying again&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a wave of his hand, Mo Hua declares, &quot;Buying!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun wonders, &quot;Isn&#39;t it a few days till New Year&#39;s? Did your family give you your New Year&#39;s money so early?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua responds, slightly annoyed, &quot;What New Year&#39;s money? This is money I&#39;ve earned myself!&quot; He pats his pocket as he speaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing the clear sound of spirit stones clinking in the pocket, Old Sun perks up and eagerly says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have all kinds of pills, arrays, and tools here, all beautiful and affordable, guaranteed satisfaction, and all from Wanbao Building, so you know the quality is top-notch. What are you looking to buy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the quality was really top-notch, Wanbao Building would sell it themselves, but Mo Hua isn&rsquo;t concerned; he can&#39;t afford Wanbao Building&rsquo;s prices anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you have any fire-resisting spiritual tools?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun, with a knowing look, pulls out a burlap bag and spreads it out in front of Mo Hua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You mentioned this a few days ago, and I paid attention. I went back and specifically found a few excellent fire-resisting tools, all portable and beautifully designed. What do you think?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua is surprised at Old Sun&#39;s preparedness, a testament to decades of market experience, always ready to seize a business opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spiritual tools displayed before Mo Hua vary in style: there are rings, jade pendants, lampstands, and even a hood and a scarf&hellip; By the looks of it, his stall is the most well-stocked in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a careful examination, Mo Hua picks up a hairpin, antique in design yet delicate, and asks, &quot;What is this pin?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun explains, &quot;This is a fire-resisting hairpin, a standard-issue spiritual tool. It&rsquo;s made to a uniform standard, with a basic fire-resisting array carved on it. It needs to be charged with spirit stones, and when activated, it can isolate fire qi, keeping the wearer cool. Though it consumes spirit stones, one stone can last three months, making it quite economical&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua looks doubtful, &quot;A standard-issue tool from Wanbao Building being sold here must have some defects, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun laughs, &quot;You know quite a bit. If there were no defects, it would be twice as expensive at Wanbao Building. But saying it has defects is not quite right&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pointing at the peony pattern on the pin, Old Sun continues, &quot;The craftsman added a few extra strokes while engraving this peony, so it didn&#39;t meet the standard and was categorized as a second-grade item. But the array inside is intact, and its effectiveness remains the same.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua nods, feeling this pin is the most suitable, and asks, &quot;How many spirit stones?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun strokes his beard, &quot;A flat rate, fifteen spirit stones!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua shakes his head, &quot;Five!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun&rsquo;s eyes widen, &quot;Who taught you to bargain like this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua, a bit embarrassed, &quot;I heard it at other stalls, that&rsquo;s how they all haggle&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun laments, &quot;The times are indeed changing for the worse, even good kids are getting corrupted!&quot; Then he says, &quot;Fourteen stones, I can&rsquo;t go any lower.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua tentatively offers, &quot;Six?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some haggling, they settle on ten stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun feels he can&#39;t go any lower, not a single spirit stone less, and Mo Hua, having inquired about the prices at other stalls, knows there&#39;s no cheaper deal, so he agrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun takes the spirit stones from Mo Hua and wraps the hairpin in a cheap but nicely made paper box, handing it over while constantly muttering:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If my grandson were half as clever as you, I&rsquo;d have him man the stall, but alas, my grandson is too</p>\r\n\r\n<p>simple, barely speaks to strangers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua, satisfied with the purchase, waves goodbye to Old Sun and walks away with a spring in his step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A nearby stall owner chuckles, &quot;Old Sun, you lost money this time!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Sun strokes his beard, &quot;Not really, just made a little less.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stall owner, curious, asks, &quot;Ten spirit stones is no small sum, I wonder who the kid bought the hairpin for.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fire-resisting hairpins are for resisting the qi of the stove, who else could it be for?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching Mo Hua&#39;s figure gradually receding into the distance, Old Sun sighs softly, &quot;He&#39;s a good kid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua&#39;s home is on a quiet street at the edge of Tongxian City. The house is old and just big enough for a family of three. The neighborhood is mostly inhabited by low-level Qi-cultivating loose cultivators who make a living by doing odd jobs. Although not wealthy, the community is vibrant with everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evening falls, smoke rises from the houses, and dim lights flicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua rushes through the door, calling, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m back!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plainly dressed woman with a gentle face steps out from the inner room. Seeing Mo Hua, her eyes light up with surprise, and she pulls him close, touching his head and pinching his face, before saying, &quot;Have you been working too hard at cultivation? You&#39;ve lost a lot of weight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua replies, &quot;I haven&#39;t lost weight,&quot; and then takes out the box, &quot;Mom, this is for you!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman, momentarily stunned, opens the box to find a hairpin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a fire-resisting hairpin. You work in the kitchen at the inn, and being exposed to the heat for long periods isn&#39;t good for your health. This pin can shield you from the heat, making you feel much cooler.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman, named Liu Ruhua, is Mo Hua&#39;s mother and a low-level Qi-cultivating loose cultivator in Tongxian City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life as a loose cultivator is tough, and there aren&rsquo;t many good opportunities to earn spirit stones, especially for those with children. Raising a child, covering living expenses, and affording the materials needed for cultivation pose significant challenges for ordinary cultivators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua has good culinary skills and helps in the kitchen of a small inn in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larger inns usually use stoves crafted by artisans, which consume spirit stones to convert spiritual energy into cooking heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To save costs, smaller inns do not use spirit stones for cooking but instead have cultivators with fire spiritual roots use their spiritual power to generate cooking heat. Over time, this can harm the body, drying out the meridians and causing symptoms like lung pain and dry coughs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Liu Ruhua works in the kitchen, she periodically uses her spiritual power to provide heat, earning about thirty spirit stones a month. Although it harms her health, it&#39;s considered a decent job for loose cultivators, many of whom would like the opportunity but don&#39;t get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the hairpin in her hand, Liu Ruhua presses her lips together, silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua quickly adds, &quot;The spirit stones for the hairpin were earned by helping fellow disciples, no cheating, stealing, or robbing involved!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua can&#39;t help but smile, feeling warm yet slightly teary, &quot;I can&#39;t accept this hairpin, dear. You&#39;re still young, and you&rsquo;ll need many spirit stones for your future cultivation. Save them. I can take care of myself; you don&rsquo;t need to worry&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua confidently says, &quot;We can worry about the future later. Maybe I&#39;ll become a great cultivator at the Golden Core or Nascent Soul stage one day, and then I&#39;ll have as many spirit stones as I need.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua laughs, tapping Mo Hua&#39;s forehead, &quot;At such a young age, you&#39;ve already learned to boast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mom, please keep it. I bargained with others for a long time to buy it. If you don&#39;t take it, then I wasted all that effort.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua then takes the hairpin and carefully inserts it into Liu Ruhua&rsquo;s hair, then runs to get a mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look, does it look good?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing the reflection of the woman in the mirror, adorned with the simple yet elegant hairpin, and looking graceful and beautiful, Liu Ruhua&rsquo;s heart softens, and she gently says, &quot;I&#39;ll keep the hairpin. But next time, I won&#39;t accept any more gifts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Mo Hua nods repeatedly, &quot;Mom, is dinner ready? I&#39;m hungry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, it&#39;s all your favorite dishes, eat up!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua is an excellent cook, and although the dishes are simple and lack spiritual essence, they are delicately and deliciously prepared. After eating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and chatting with his mother, Mo Hua returns to his room to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After midnight, Mo Hua enters his sea of knowledge and practices array formations on the Dao Stele all night. When he wakes, it&rsquo;s dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua sits cross-legged, holding a spirit stone, continuing his routine cultivation practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he opens his eyes again, the sky is slightly bright, and the beautiful morning sunlight shines into the room. Mo Hua stretches lazily in bed, preparing to get up, then hears heavy footsteps outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua rolls over and peers through the door crack, seeing a man covered in bloodstains and looking exhausted step into the house &mdash; it&#39;s Mo Hua&#39;s father, Mo Shan.</p>', 4, '2025-04-15 18:31:01', '2025-04-15 18:31:01'),
(67, 22, 'Chapter 5: Mo Shan', 'chapter-5-mo-shan', '<p>Mo Shan is a Qi-cultivation beast hunter of the eighth level who makes his living by hunting demonic beasts and harvesting their materials. Though it sounds impressive, it is in fact a grueling and risky occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most demonic beasts in the cultivation world are far stronger than human cultivators, making them exceedingly difficult to hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, demonic beasts of the same realm require a team of five to ten cultivators for a successful hunt, and even then, success isn&#39;t guaranteed. Even if the beast is slain, its more valuable parts are often damaged during the fight, fetching only a modest sum of spirit stones. The profits, once divided according to each team member&#39;s contribution, are minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Injuries are another hazard. The cost of medicinal pills for treatment can be substantial, potentially leading to a financial deficit. A serious injury might permanently end a hunter&#39;s ability to make a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan is a burly man, a solo practitioner with a rugged, handsome face marked by the trials of his trade. Though still young by cultivator standards, his life outdoors has weathered his appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon entering his home, Mo Shan sets down his blade and the unknown beast&#39;s pelt he carried on his shoulder, sighing in relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His coat is worn and stained with blood, both fresh and old&mdash;mostly from beasts, but some from himself or his comrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This hunt must have been rough,&quot; Mo Hua guessed quietly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan&#39;s brows were furrowed, his expression somber, and his blood-stained clothes added a forbidding air to his presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this fierceness melted away when he saw his wife, like a battle-weary warrior returning home, shedding his heavy, scar-laden armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is everything okay at home?&quot; Mo Shan asked, his voice hoarse from fatigue but still gentle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua was tidying his belongings and fetched a clean cloth to wipe his face. &quot;Everything is fine at home, don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing his dusty face, she couldn&#39;t help saying, &quot;Take care of yourself when you&#39;re outside.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan smiled and then looked around the house. &quot;Has Hua&#39;er returned?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He just got back yesterday. The sect is on holiday now, and he&#39;s probably still asleep. I&#39;ll go wake him; he&#39;ll be so happy to know you&#39;re back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan glanced at the blood and wounds on his clothes and stopped her. &quot;Let him sleep a bit more. Sect cultivation is tough too. I&#39;ll take a bath first, apply some herbal medicine, and change these clothes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a good idea. Why don&#39;t you eat something first?&quot; Liu Ruhua suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having traveled all night, Mo Shan was famished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua&#39;s cooking was excellent, and even though the meals were simple, Mo Shan devoured them hungrily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, he would have to settle for cold, hard rations or sparingly use vitalizing pills. But now, eating the meals his wife prepared washed away all his fatigue and hardships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan ate a lot and drank a large bowl of fragrant, sticky porridge, finally exhaling a long breath of relief. Liu Ruhua, noticing the bloodstains on his clothes, then asked worriedly, &quot;Did someone get hurt again?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We lost three, and Old Chu was seriously injured,&quot; Mo Shan sighed as he began to recount the hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We were eight when we cornered a demonic wolf over three meters tall. We had it trapped and were slowly draining its demonic energy to finish it off. However, another hunting team passed by&mdash;mostly novices who hadn&#39;t seen much blood yet. They recklessly tried to steal our kill and ended up being devoured by the beast...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The beast replenished its energy from their blood and went berserk. Old Chu and I used up all our spiritual energy to finally take it down, but the loss was heavy. Old Chu lost an arm and bled profusely; his vital energy severely depleted. He might not be able to continue as a hunter...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Old Chu has a two-year-old child, and his wife only supplements their income with some gardening. Now with his severe injuries and the high cost of healing pills, even if he recovers, I don&#39;t know how his family will manage,&quot; Mo Shan added bitterly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua sighed, &quot;When we were in a tough spot, Old Chu lent us some spirit stones even though he wasn&#39;t well-off. We still have some saved; let&#39;s give them to Old Chu first to at least get him treated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan nodded, &quot;That wolf beast hasn&#39;t been sold yet; it should fetch about three hundred spirit stones. We&#39;ll give Old Chu a larger share and lend him some more to get through this, but...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan felt guilty, &quot;Hua&#39;er is supposed to start his sect cultivation next year... I was hoping to earn enough from this hunt, but now...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua held his hand,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As long as the family is safe, we can always find a way to earn spirit stones. I&#39;ve saved some from working in the tavern kitchen, and we can borrow some more. It won&#39;t delay Hua&#39;er&#39;s cultivation next year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan looked silently at his wife, her once youthful and beautiful face now slightly worn. He felt even more remorseful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Quit the kitchen job at the tavern. The heat harms the heart, lungs, and meridians. Next year, I&#39;ll find more hunters, kill more beasts, and earn more spirit stones. I won&#39;t let you suffer like this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua smiled wryly, proud yet modest, and pointed to her hairpin, &quot;See what this is?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan hadn&#39;t noticed when he walked in, but now, he saw that the hairpin was different from the usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s this pin?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s a gift from Hua&#39;er, called a Fire-Resisting Hairpin. It wards off the heat from the stove, keeping the heart and meridians much cooler.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hua&#39;er is really thoughtful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan felt both reassured and ashamed, &quot;I haven&#39;t given you a gift in years...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua chuckled, &quot;Hua&#39;er is your son, so his gift is as if you gave it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Shan laughed, then bittersweetly added, &quot;In cultivation, they often talk about fate. Perhaps my greatest fortune in this life is having a wife like you and a sensible son like Hua&#39;er.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Ruhua playfully glared at her husband, but couldn&#39;t help laughing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching his wife&#39;s smile, Mo Shan silently resolved to recruit more skilled beast hunters after the new year, aiming to venture deeper into the mountains to slay more demonic beasts, earn more spirit stones, and ensure his family would not endure such hardships. Moreover, he was determined to secure a better future for his son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mo Hua heard everything from inside the house, and sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unbeknownst to him, his parents had always endured the hardships of the cultivation life. Perhaps in any world, the burdens parents bear are always much heavier than their children imagine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as cultivators, they toiled for spirit stones and struggled for a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though cultivators and mortals may seem different, in some ways, they are not so different at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reflecting on this, Mo Hua wondered silently, &quot;Is there a way I too can earn spirit stones?&quot;</p>', 5, '2025-04-15 18:31:30', '2025-04-15 18:31:30'),

The surroundings were adorned with white buildings that seemed to float atop the clouds. Such a breathtaking sight would leave any earthling in awe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Noah didn&#39;t have the luxury to marvel at the scenery. His gaze was utterly captivated by an otherworldly beauty lying nearby, as still as Sleeping Beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had snow-white hair and wore a close-fitting, white-and-gold garment that accentuated her perfect proportions. Her aura radiated a mixture of coldness and majesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah was in complete shock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All he did was head downstairs to collect a delivery. He hadn&#39;t been hit by a truck, nor was he some unlucky high schooler from an island nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did this even happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossing over to Teyvat? Sure, no complaints. But why was the landing point Celestia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Sustainer of Heavenly Principles is going to wake up any second now and kill me&hellip;&quot; Noah stared nervously at the goddess-like woman who seemed to be in deep sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before he could fully grasp his situation, a burst of blinding white light overwhelmed his vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The light came quickly and faded just as fast. A surge of divinity, supreme and absolute power, coursed through his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had become the Heavenly Principle!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former Heavenly Principle, Phanes, had perished shortly after the Khaenri&#39;ah Cataclysm five centuries ago. Before their death, Phanes entrusted all authority to be safeguarded on Celestia by Asmoday, one of the Four Shades and Ruler of Space, waiting for the next individual to assume the role of protector and overseer of Teyvat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, by some cosmic twist of fate, Noah had inherited this immense power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, I just snatched someone else&#39;s chance?&quot; Noah&#39;s face showed a complex mix of emotions, though his heart pounded uncontrollably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inheriting an entire world upon arrival placed him among the top-tier protagonists&mdash;the kind that start at the very top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While elated, he was equally apprehensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Heavenly Principle, he now bore the weight of safeguarding all of Teyvat. Even Phanes, an immensely powerful entity, hadn&#39;t survived. How was a mere newcomer from Earth supposed to shoulder such responsibility?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information conveyed from the Heavenly Throne painted a grim picture of Teyvat: the world&#39;s very foundations were riddled with holes. In less than a decade, Teyvat would collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The world will last only ten more years. To wear the crown is to bear its burden&hellip;&quot; Noah swallowed hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Heavenly Throne came near-omniscient knowledge about Teyvat. It was as if he had access to the world&#39;s control panel. Yet the flood of issues now overwhelming his mind left him drenched in cold sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the full authority of the Heavenly Principles, solving Teyvat&#39;s problems seemed impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What now?&quot; Noah thought aloud. &quot;Do I enjoy the perks of being Heavenly Principle for a bit, then hand the throne to Lumine after she conquers the Seven Nations?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wasn&#39;t how he imagined a transmigration would unfold. No cheats? No advantages?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;System, are you there?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Heaven-Defying Comprehension talent from the Earth Mother?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Imaginary Tree, Quantum Sea&mdash;grant me your power!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Multiverse Chat Group?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Simulator?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah muttered nonsensically, grasping at straws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding!

Enumerating host&#39;s abilities&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As information surged into his mind, Noah&#39;s eyes widened in astonishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A system! As expected of a transmigrator!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A familiar game-like interface appeared on his retinas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Name]: Noah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Role]: Heavenly Principle of Teyvat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Authorities]:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Primordial Law Ring (Incomplete): Governs all laws and authorities of Teyvat. Portions of its fragments have been used to create gods and can be reclaimed upon their deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Aether Anchors: Core structures stabilizing Teyvat&#39;s dimensional bubble within the Quantum Sea. Functions include creating false heavens and repairing leylines using Divine Nails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Light Realm Force System: Harnesses Teyvat&#39;s seven elements, creates Visions, and merges elements into Light Realm Force to craft all things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Human Realm Force System: Collects human faith to form Divine Seats, evaluates the strength of wishes, and distributes Visions. The culmination of all human desires becomes the Human Realm Force that weaves destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Constellation System: Determines the fate of all intelligent life in Teyvat, gathers Ascension Stars, and guides chosen beings to their Divine Seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaining clarity from the system interface, Noah began to calm down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Heavenly Principle, his strength was undeniable; he wielded the majority of Teyvat&#39;s world authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;System, what can you do?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The priority was to understand his cheat&#39;s capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding! The system has transitioned to the Dimensional Sovereign System.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Functions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Search for world coordinates based on the host&#39;s knowledge of the multiverse..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Establish portals linking different worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Facilitate the annexation of connected worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Design detailed plans for annexing different worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Annexing worlds! Such overpowered functionality?&quot; Noah inhaled sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. Correct.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he recovered from his shock, Noah quickly asked, &quot;System, can annexing other worlds resolve Teyvat&#39;s impending collapse?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Analyzing solution based on Teyvat&#39;s current situation&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding! Analysis complete.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Incorporate foreign laws to enrich Teyvat&#39;s rule system and transform forbidden knowledge into beneficial knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Absorb underworld or infernal dimensions to neutralize Abyssal energy and create Teyvat&#39;s own underworld and reincarnation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Assimilate external energy systems to refine Teyvat&#39;s Vision-based divine system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Merge annexed worlds into Teyvat or establish them as lower realms, strengthening Teyvat&#39;s foundation and barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Recruit deities from annexed worlds to bolster Teyvat&#39;s pantheon and enhance governance authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon seeing the dozens of options listed, Noah&#39;s last ounce of worry dissipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A transmigrator with cheats is truly blessed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without cheats, he&#39;d cower in fear. With cheats, he would punch through every obstacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a deep breath, Noah steadied his excited heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;System, begin searching for world coordinates!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. Based on the host&#39;s memory, three worlds have been located&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Demon Slayer] [Akame ga Kill!] [Inuyasha]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the three options that appeared before him, Noah was a little surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hadn&#39;t expected these three worlds to come up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was the system selecting worlds based on Teyvat&#39;s needs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. Based on the host&#39;s world condition, priority is given to targets that can compensate for the world&#39;s deficiencies.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Demon Slayer: Incorporating this world&#39;s laws would improve the Vision-to-Godhood system by 5%. Annexation would grant access to Primary Immortality and a new set of rules called Paranormal Laws, which could break the single-attribute limitation of Visions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Akame ga Kill!: Annexation would reinforce Teyvat&#39;s world barriers, providing initial protection against Quantum Sea erosion and extending Teyvat&#39;s lifespan by 100,000 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Inuyasha: This world possesses relatively complete laws governing the Underworld, Reincarnation, Demons, and a fragmented Divine System. Annexing it would neutralize the Abyss&#39; harmful energies, allow Teyvat to establish a reincarnation system, and create a safer environment. Additionally, Demon Laws would enable elemental creatures to evolve towards demon-like forms, granting them intelligence and the ability to take human shape, thus improving Teyvat&#39;s ecosystem at its core. The fragmented Divine System could further refine Teyvat&#39;s pantheon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Annexing all three worlds would extend Teyvat&#39;s existence by 500,000 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listening to the system, Noah&#39;s blood boiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just imagining such a grand undertaking awakened his primal instincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, what&#39;s the plan to annex these three worlds?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone could dream up grandiose ideas, but the execution plan was what truly mattered. Without a feasible approach, it was just empty talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Analyzing&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Analysis complete.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Demon Slayer World: The system suggested embedding the Vision-to-Godhood system into the world&#39;s myths, subtly rewriting its fate. Using the host&#39;s authority, the Primordial Law Ring, Noah could absorb the world&#39;s laws and integrate it as a lower realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah furrowed his brow at the overly technical explanation but quickly pieced together the gist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, I just grant people in the Demon Slayer world Visions, have Teyvat&#39;s people act as their historical gods or saints, and use that deception to seize control of the world&#39;s authority? Why make it sound so complicated?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. The system will simplify the terminology if needed&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, no, keep it as is. It&#39;s fine,&quot; Noah said flatly, refusing to admit he had struggled to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Continue with the plans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Akame ga Kill!: The same strategy could apply here. However, additional steps were necessary. The host&#39;s Human Realm Force System would need to gather faith from at least 80% of the population. Once this threshold was met, the world&#39;s authority would automatically shift to the host.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Collecting faith? With how corrupt and dark the empire in Akame ga Kill! is, that&#39;s practically child&#39;s play.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah nodded in agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humanity was most prone to seeking salvation in times of despair, and the empire&#39;s common folk were undoubtedly the most desperate, comprising 99% of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By sending down a &quot;god&quot; to perform miracles and save the people, success would be nearly guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What about the Inuyasha world?&quot; Noah asked. &quot;That world is much more structurally complete than Teyvat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the upper limits of power in Inuyasha&#39;s world were slightly lower than Teyvat&#39;s, they weren&#39;t that far off. Top-tier demons could raze cities at will, their monstrous forms rivaling low-level Archons. Furthermore, that world once had gods, even if they had vanished as humanity took center stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annexing the Inuyasha world wouldn&#39;t be easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[To annex the Inuyasha world, the Vision-to-Godhood system must become mainstream. The host must also use the Human Realm Force System to establish Divine Seats, appoint earthly governors, and assume control over mortal and underworld authorities.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah&#39;s face twitched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that just reenacting the Archon War in the Inuyasha world?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the chaos in the Inuyasha world mirrored Teyvat&#39;s Archon War era. However, the scale was akin to a low-budget version of that legendary conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Anything else?&quot; Noah inquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[All plans complete. After annexing the three worlds, the system will proceed to locate new world coordinates.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Got it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah nodded. Now, it was up to him to execute these plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the groundwork was laid. It was as though the meal had already been served&mdash;he just needed to eat it. If he couldn&#39;t handle this, he might as well let the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles smother him with her&hellip; divine assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Next up, I&#39;ll prepare the Seven Nations of Teyvat for their roles in the plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, Lumine was just leaving Mondstadt and heading toward Liyue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Teyvat was a chaotic mess, the annexation plan could still be implemented immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, and Fontaine&mdash;despite their issues&mdash;had functioning governments that could carry out orders with slight adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sumeru, however, was a disaster from top to bottom. Assigning them to manage an annexation would likely result in internal power struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Natlan, the constant infighting meant they were too preoccupied to focus on external matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst, however, was Snezhnaya. While Tsaritsa was reliable, her Fatui harbingers had effectively hollowed out her authority. Each of them was a backstabbing opportunist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he involved them in the annexation, they&#39;d probably overthrow him as the Heavenly Principle the moment they gained power. No doubt they&#39;d justify it with something like, &quot;If an outsider like you can rule, why can&#39;t we locals?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Divine Seats system makes contacting the Seven Archons pretty convenient, like a godly version of the internet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah glanced at the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles, who lay in a deep sleep, resisting Abyssal corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First, I&#39;ll wake her up and summon the Four Shades for a meeting on Celestia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Noah had inherited Celestia&#39;s throne and Teyvat&#39;s authority, he still lacked proficiency. It was like handing a toddler an AK-47&mdash;he barely knew how to wield it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While he trusted the Four Shades not to attack him, he couldn&#39;t rule out rash decisions in heated moments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sustainer of Heavenly Principles, Asmoday, was someone Noah could fully trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was one of Phanes&#39; shadows, tasked with guarding Teyvat. Harming Noah, the current Heavenly Principle, would be akin to harming the world itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;System, is there a way to dispel the Abyssal power afflicting Asmoday?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. Analyzing&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Analysis complete.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[The host can transfer the Ruler of Space&#39;s corrupted powers onto themselves.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Huh? Phanes died from this stuff. Wouldn&#39;t I keel over too?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[The system ensures the host is immune to negative effects.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah exhaled in relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Next time, say everything in one go. Don&#39;t scare me like that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding. Adjusting communication protocols based on the host&#39;s feedback.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Awaken, my celestial fairy...&quot; Noah placed his hand on Asmoday&#39;s chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wow... bigger than they look...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dark, eerie, cold energy erupted from Asmoday&#39;s body, resembling tentacles, and surged into Noah&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Ding! Abnormal energy detected. Activating antivirus protocols.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Abyssal power was instantly purged as it entering his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday&#39;s condition visibly improved.

For a brief moment, she seemed taken aback, her ethereal beauty made all the more striking by her dazed expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her long, snow-white hair, cascading like a silver waterfall, shifted slightly as she tilted her head.

After all, life&#39;s a stage, and a little drama makes everything more interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since you&#39;ve inherited everything from her, and you possess the ability to purify Abyssal power, this world is bound to be safe under your rule.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday visibly relaxed, her slender frame losing its rigid tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having dealt with the Abyss for millennia, she knew better than anyone&mdash;except perhaps Phanes&mdash;just how insidious and unrelenting Abyssal power could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was precisely because no solution existed to combat the Abyss that Phanes had gradually succumbed to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the new Heavenly Principle couldn&#39;t handle it either, she would surely follow in Phanes&#39; footsteps this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I want isn&#39;t just a safe world&mdash;I want Teyvat to ascend, to rise above the status of a mere world bubble and become the eternal, singular world within the Quantum Sea.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah stepped closer, placing a hand on Asmoday&#39;s shoulder with casual confidence. The contrast between his bold demeanor and the shimmering, otherworldly presence of the goddess before him was striking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Human Realm Force System and its connection to the Divine Seats, he conveyed his vision to her: his ability as the new Heavenly Principle to devour worlds and elevate Teyvat to a higher existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, he left out the part about the system, framing its power as an extension of his own authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday&#39;s golden eyes widened slightly, their radiant depths trembling with shock as the flood of information filled her mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Devouring other worlds to repair Teyvat&#39;s flaws while evolving it through this overwhelming method into an infinitely progressing world&mdash;it was a concept both brutal and brilliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also received details about the three targeted worlds and the benefits Teyvat would gain from annexing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as the initial shock faded, her expression shifted to one of fervent determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successfully annexing those three worlds would solve the majority of Teyvat&#39;s current crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, it would extend the world&#39;s existence by 500,000 years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put that into perspective, Phanes&#39; reign over Teyvat hadn&#39;t even spanned 10,000 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five hundred thousand years was virtually equivalent to eternity for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power wielded by this new Heavenly Principle far surpassed even Phanes at their peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Asmoday, as the Sustainer of the Heavenly Principles, you could be considered one of my subordinates, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah&#39;s words snapped the snow-haired, golden-eyed goddess back to reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging by her fanatical expression, he didn&#39;t even need to convince her&mdash;she would be his unwavering supporter no matter what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, your will is my will. Please, use me however you wish.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday&#39;s gaze burned with devotion as she looked at her new master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, her thoughts were singular: to follow this new ruler, help him grow stronger, and lead Teyvat to unprecedented heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arrival of such a powerful new Heavenly Principle was surely the culmination of thousands of years of good karma from Phanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Use you however I wish, huh? Could you elaborate on that?&quot; Noah&#39;s eyes gleamed mischievously as they trailed over the flawless golden proportions of Asmoday&#39;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot; Asmoday blinked in confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ahem, I mean, the most important thing right now is summoning the Seven Archons to Celestia for a meeting. A plan as grand as annexing worlds can only be carried out with their cooperation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah quickly averted his gaze, coughing awkwardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn&#39;t a complete lecher, after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday&#39;s beauty and grace made her the most stunning and elegant woman he had ever encountered, a true goddess in every sense of the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, after settling the matter of Teyvat&#39;s survival, he could have a private conversation with her about the finer details of life between a Heavenly Principle and their loyal Sustainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will summon them immediately,&quot; Asmoday said, her expression turning stern and authoritative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a matter as vital as strengthening and elevating Teyvat, she wouldn&#39;t allow anyone to slack off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also knew that among the Seven Archons, there were those who were duplicitous. If any of them defied the will of the Heavenly Principle, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to replace them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll summon them myself,&quot; Noah interjected, grabbing Asmoday&#39;s arm to stop her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cold sweat dripped down his back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If she went and encountered the mess in Sumeru, Fontaine, Snezhnaya, or Inazuma&mdash;the schemes and incompetence of their rulers&mdash;she might explode on the spot and start killing people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Asmoday nodded. &quot;Your will is my will.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Human Realm Force System and the hierarchy of the Divine Seats, Noah sent out messages to summon the Archons of Wind, Rock, Thunder, and Water to Celestia for a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All right. While we wait for them, I&#39;ll rearrange the layout of Celestia a bit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He chuckled to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A summons from the Heavenly Principle? That would certainly scare the living daylights out of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, even the original Seven Archons had barely interacted with Phanes. Only Morax had ever seen Phanes face-to-face. Barbatos hadn&#39;t even caught a glimpse during his ascension to godhood after the Archon War&mdash;it was Asmoday who had distributed the Gnosis and Visions on Phanes&#39; behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the Gnosis weren&#39;t as rare as they seemed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were merely tools within the Human Realm Force System used to absorb and store faith energy, stabilizing a nation&#39;s leylines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their primary purpose was to take over stabilizing the leylines in case the Heavenly Principle was severely weakened or dying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Noah was the new Heavenly Principle, with full control over Teyvat&#39;s leylines, the Divine Hearts were practically obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While they still contained near-limitless faith and leyline energy, they only offered power equivalent to a low-tier Archon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the Seven Archons, they were little more than trophies commemorating their victory in the Archon War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mondstadt</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angel&#39;s Share Tavern</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Diluc, just one more drink! Just one! To soothe the sadness of parting with the Traveler. Please~&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A green-clad bard clasped his hands in a pleading gesture, his kitten-like face imploring the red-haired man silently wiping glasses behind the counter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve already used this excuse three times to drink for free, and every time you want the best wine we have,&quot; Diluc replied with an expressionless face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he didn&#39;t know this shameless bard was Barbatos himself, the Anemo Archon, he would have had the bartender throw him out long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is the last time, I swear! Pretty please, Diluc~&quot; Venti switched tactics, shamelessly resorting to acting cute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...&quot; Diluc&#39;s brows furrowed so tightly they nearly touched, but he remained unmoved. Archon or not, freeloading at Dawn Winery wasn&#39;t going to fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he set a precedent, his business would go under with Barbatos&#39; drinking habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ahh...&quot; Venti sighed dramatically, his shoulders slumping as he realized his free wine dreams were dashed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he was about to head out and earn Mora with a street performance, his expression suddenly changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His light teal eyes went wide in disbelief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No way&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Diluc&#39;s confused gaze, Venti transformed into a gust of teal wind and vanished from the Angel&#39;s Share tavern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diluc didn&#39;t think much of it. He merely assumed the Anemo Archon had sulked away after failing to freeload another drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, the dragon crisis had just been resolved, and the Fatui were under the watchful eye of the Knights of Favonius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, he couldn&#39;t believe the Anemo Archon was so weak that Mondstadt would suffer one calamity after another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s been over a thousand years of silence, and now this happens&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only message Venti had received was a terse, six-word command: &quot;Come to Celestia for a meeting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the message was brief, its implications were massive. The only entity capable of directly contacting the Divine Seat of the Anemo Archon was the one from Celestia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Khaenri&#39;ah Cataclysm, Venti&#39;s connection to the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles had essentially been severed, leading many to speculate that her time was running out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why, then, had this connection suddenly become so active?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it mean that she had returned from the dead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m in big trouble&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venti broke into a cold sweat&mdash;a remarkable feat for a wind spirit&mdash;as he recalled handing over his Gnosis to Tsaritsa just the day before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Sustainer learned he had supported Tsaritsa&#39;s rebellion and even gifted her the Gnosis, she might reduce him to pure Anemo energy on the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was all done in secret, and I never contacted Tsaritsa directly. I shouldn&#39;t get caught, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trembling slightly, Venti wiped his sweatless forehead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If questioned, he&#39;d claim the Gnosis was stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&#39;d say he had used all his power to maintain the Thousand Winds and protect Mondstadt&#39;s environment, leaving him defenseless against Tsaritsa&#39;s underlings, like La Signora, who had ambushed him and stolen the Gnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At worst, he&#39;d only be charged with negligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sorry, Tsaritsa. You were going to rebel against the Heavenly Principles anyway.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venti recalled an old saying from Liyue: Better to let a friend suffer than yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll say if it comes to that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Anyway, the meeting won&#39;t just be for me. I&#39;ll chat with the old man to get a better sense of what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liyue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Third-Round Knockout Tavern</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At that time, the Nightmare God controlled the Yakshas, and they came charging in with unstoppable force. The people were utterly despairing, convinced that our Guili Assembly was about to be obliterated by overwhelming power. But guess what happened?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Come on, Tian Tiezui, wasn&#39;t it our Lord Morax who single-handedly stopped the god at Dihua Marsh and rescued the controlled Yakshas? The very same Yakshas who are now the Immortal Yakshas we know today?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly! This is such an old tale, Tian Tiezui. We&#39;ve heard it a hundred times. Why don&#39;t you tell us something new for a change?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, when it comes to history, who could possibly know more than Wangsheng Funeral Parlor&#39;s consultant, Mr. Zhongli?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this, the crowd turned their respectful gazes toward a serene and cultured man seated in the best spot for watching the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You flatter me. I&#39;ve simply read more ancient texts than most. Much of history is buried in the past, and even the most learned historians can only offer vague interpretations,&quot; Zhongli replied, lowering his teacup and speaking with calm gravitas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is why we must rely on one another to piece together the weight of history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mr. Zhongli, despite your awe-inspiring knowledge, you remain so humble. Truly admirable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Indeed! It&#39;s no wonder Director Hu personally recruited you as a consultant.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mr. Zhongli, do you have any additional insights into the tale of the Lord of Rock saving the Yakshas?&quot; Tian Tiezui1 inquired earnestly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had to admit his version of the story was stale. If he could gather fresh details from Zhongli, he&#39;d be able to refine and embellish his narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhongli nodded, about to share some lesser-known aspects of the historical event when he suddenly froze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the tea in his cup nearly spilled from his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My apologies, I have urgent matters to attend to. Another day, I shall recount what I know of history for your enjoyment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a polite bow, Zhongli excused himself and rose to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron Tongue Tian</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:21:12', '2025-04-16 05:21:12'),
(70, 24, 'Chapter 3: Summoning the Seven Archons to an Audience', 'chapter-3-summoning-the-seven-archons-to-an-audience', '<p>&quot;Looks like Director Hu is giving Zhongli a hard time again, probably making him go recruit business,&quot; someone commented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;True, Director Hu always comes up with such strange ideas,&quot; another replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his way back to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Zhongli&#39;s expression was heavy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the one from Celestia had contacted him was a highly abnormal occurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In over six millennia, though he had occasionally caught a distant glimpse of that being, they had never once personally contacted any of the Seven Archons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, the connection between the one above and his own Geo Archon Divine Seat was now tighter than it had ever been, even when she was in her prime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had she fully recovered and grown even stronger?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did this mean for Liyue&mdash;good fortune or impending disaster?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, whenever she acted, it was never during times of peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the war against the Second Throne that shattered Teyvat&#39;s lands, to the Archon War that engulfed the land in fire and blood, to the Khaenri&#39;ah Cataclysm five centuries ago&mdash;none of it boded well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, well! Zhongli, what&#39;s with the long face? Did the bird you had your eye on get snatched by someone else?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment Zhongli stepped across the threshold of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a lively and mischievous voice greeted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Director Hu, I have personal matters to attend to and would like to request a few days off.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Days off? Zhongli, isn&#39;t every day basically a holiday for you? Drinking tea, birdwatching, enjoying the opera&mdash;you don&#39;t even do much real work!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hu Tao huffed indignantly as she slammed a thick pile of bills onto the table in front of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Besides, Mingxing Jewelry just sent me a whole stack of invoices this morning. What did you buy this time? And why is it so expensive?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Director Hu,&quot; Zhongli replied calmly, choosing not to argue and waiting patiently for her response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah... Fine, fine. I can never win against you. You can have five days off, but I have a condition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hu Tao placed her hands on her hips, a look of reluctant resignation on her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although her consultant spent money like water and even paid extra instead of bargaining, his knowledge was unparalleled. His ability to generate revenue justified his extravagant habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Please, name it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you&#39;re back, I want you to hand out flyers and recruit clients. I&#39;ve got a brilliant idea!&quot; Hu Tao exclaimed as she unfurled a massive half-meter-long piece of paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With my creativity and your way with words, we&#39;ll have Wangsheng&#39;s business booming in no time!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey? Zhongli? Where&#39;d you go?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hu Tao&#39;s smug tone quickly turned to confusion as she realized the towering figure of Zhongli had disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t even finish explaining my idea!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Zhongli! When you&#39;re back, I&#39;m docking your pay!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Wind and Geo Archons seemed relatively composed regarding the Heavenly Principle&#39;s summons, the Hydro Archon Focalors was far more on edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment she received the message, she fled her seat in the Oratrice, pale with worry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was her first time receiving a notification from Celestia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, her Divine Seat and godhood had been forcibly passed to her by the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had never seen the Heavenly Principle or even the Four Shades of The Heavenly Principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Could it be that my plans have already been discovered by the Heavenly Principle?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focalors raised her head and looked toward the sky, a sense of powerlessness and fear washing over her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What she was planning was a direct affront to Celestia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If exposed, the consequences would be catastrophic. She and Fontaine would likely face utter destruction at the hands of the Divine Nails descending from above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What should I do&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She clenched her slender hands tightly before slowly releasing them with a defeated sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If she went, she might be punished, but Fontaine could remain safe. If she didn&#39;t go, both she and Fontaine would certainly be doomed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To oppose the Heavenly Principles is to court annihilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inazuma</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark clouds suddenly rolled across the skies above Narukami Island, thunder rumbling and lightning flashing ominously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside Tenshukaku, the Raiden Shogun, seated in meditative stillness, was abruptly replaced by Raiden Ei. Her violet eyes snapped open in shock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A command from Celestia&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she and her sister were born together two thousand years ago, before the Archon War, it had always been her sister who dealt with Celestia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After her sister&#39;s death during the Khaenri&#39;ah Cataclysm five hundred years ago, Ei had inherited the Electro Archon&#39;s seat. Even then, the only communication from Celestia had been the directive to assume her sister&#39;s mantle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, Celestia had been silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She harbored resentment toward Celestia&mdash;for sending her gentle, conflict-averse sister to Khaenri&#39;ah. Yet she also held fear and reverence for Celestia&#39;s supreme authority, striving for eternity as it seemed closest to the Sustainer&#39;s ideals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, glancing at the sky, Ei transformed into a bolt of lightning and ascended toward Celestia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even her sister had only visited Celestia once, after the Archon War, to ascend to her seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What awaited her this time, Ei could not predict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she knew she had no choice. Disobeying the Heavenly Principles would mean certain doom for both herself and Inazuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Inazuma was her sister&#39;s legacy. No matter what, she would protect it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the summit of the highest peak of Narukami Island, Mt. Yougou, near the Grand Narukami Shrine, Yae Miko watched in bewilderment as Ei ascended toward Celestia in a flash of lightning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ei? She&#39;s headed to Celestia? What&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be that after locking herself away for five centuries, Ei had lost her mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or had the mental erosion of eternity finally driven her to madness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is bad!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various possibilities raced through Yae Miko&#39;s mind, filling her with panic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I need to act quickly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While she had never witnessed Celestia&#39;s judgment firsthand, the results were plain to see: the snowy peaks of Mondstadt and the desolate lands of Sumeru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequences of offending Celestia were despair itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, two of the Archons had already crossed paths en route to Celestia. As neighboring gods, Barbatos and Morax were the first to meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, old man! It&#39;s been five hundred years, and you&#39;re still as formidable as ever,&quot; Barbatos greeted warmly, his easygoing nature as evident as ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It has indeed been a long time, Barbatos. Your strength remains impressive as well,&quot; Morax replied with a small, nostalgic nod. Among the Seven Archons, he was the oldest, and he had bid farewell to countless friends. The few who remained were precious to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, come on, old man, I&#39;m nothing compared to you. So, what do you think this summons is about? You&#39;re the oldest of us&mdash;you must have some idea, right? Give me a hint, would you? I&#39;m dying of anxiety here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbatos sidled closer to Morax, lowering his voice like a nervous child seeking reassurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax shook his head at the sight of his friend&#39;s enduring carefree nature and replied, &quot;I do not know. Though I have met her a few times, her will is absolute. Each time she speaks, it signifies the onset of a great event.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A great event, huh? Old man, that just makes me even more scared.&quot; Barbatos grimaced. He already knew that a summons from the Sustainer meant something monumental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging by Morax&#39;s lack of answers, even the oldest of the Seven Archons wasn&#39;t privy to much information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah well, we&#39;ll take it one step at a time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The last time she summoned us was five hundred years ago. Back then, it was just you and me&mdash;the others were gone. This time, I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll be my turn to go.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbatos&#39; face darkened with worry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You underestimate yourself. Your strength is far from inadequate,&quot; Morax said firmly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was well-acquainted with Barbatos&#39; power. Although slightly weaker than his own, the gap wasn&#39;t significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Erosion had taken its toll. Morax himself had lost more than half his peak strength due to erosion, and he suspected Barbatos was in a similar state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erosion was their greatest foe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losing strength was manageable, but the erosion of memory and sanity loomed as an even graver threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another five hundred years, Morax feared he might succumb to the same fate as Azhdaha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further along the way, they encountered two more Archons: Baal&mdash;Ei&#39;s true name&mdash;and Focalors, the Hydro Archon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey! Ei! Focalors!&quot; Barbatos waved enthusiastically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Barbatos,&quot; Ei responded curtly. She didn&#39;t feel like chatting with the overly familiar Anemo Archon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Greetings, Morax, Barbatos, Baal,&quot; Focalors said hesitantly. This was her first time meeting the Archons of other nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Greetings, Focalors,&quot; Morax replied with a nod. He wasn&#39;t particularly familiar with the Hydro Archon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pardon me, esteemed elders, but do you know why the Heavenly Principle have summoned us?&quot; Focalors asked nervously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She hoped these three senior Archons might know more than she did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ei turned her gaze toward Morax and Barbatos. She was equally eager for answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax and Barbatos exchanged helpless glances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah, we don&#39;t know either. We&#39;ll have to wait until we reach Celestia to find out,&quot; Barbatos said, spreading his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I knew, would I have asked the old man earlier?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; Focalors sighed internally, hoping that her secret plans hadn&#39;t been discovered. If they had, Fontaine would surely suffer Celestia&#39;s wrath in the form of an icy Divine Nail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the four Archons arrived at Celestia, the outskirts of the island remained as they had always been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the central structures had undergone a dramatic transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towering above them was a grand palace, a hundred times the size of the Opera Epiclese, resplendent with gold and exuding an aura of majesty and divinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbatos and Morax, who had visited Celestia before, exchanged glances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes made one thing clear: the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles had fully recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Focalors and Ei, who were seeing Celestia for the first time, the palace seemed natural&mdash;they had no point of reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the four gods ascended the grand staircase leading into the palace, the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles&#39; sustainer greeted them coldly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Heavenly Principle are waiting for you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Um, aren&#39;t we waiting for the other three?&quot; Barbatos asked weakly, raising a hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sustainer&#39;s Abyssal corruption had completely disappeared, and her aura now matched her prime strength. It was clear that the Sustainer had indeed recovered fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The four of you are sufficient. Don&#39;t waste time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday&#39;s voice was icy as she turned and entered the palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just us four?&quot; Barbatos muttered in confusion, a chill running down his spine as a troubling thought crossed his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Anemo Archon, he had access to whispers carried by the winds of other nations. He was aware of the troubling news: Sumeru&#39;s Archon had been imprisoned by her own people, Snezhnaya was actively preparing to rebel against Celestia, and Natlan was embroiled in chaos from infighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be... the other three have already been sentenced to death by the Heavenly Principles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gulp.&quot; Barbatos swallowed hard and followed the others into the palace with heavy steps.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:21:51', '2025-04-16 05:21:51'),
(71, 24, 'Chapter 4: The End of Erosion, A Cause for Celebration Among the Archons', 'chapter-4-the-end-of-erosion-a-cause-for-celebration-among-the-archons', '<p>&quot;So, the one above has gained the power to counter the Abyss? That seems like good news,&quot; Morax remarked after observing the state of Asmoday, the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Focalors had never seen the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles in person like the first generation of Archons, she was well aware that Celestia was home not only to the Heavenly Principle but also to her Four Shades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sustainer standing before them was undoubtedly one of those Shades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the four Archons entered the grand hall, they realized immediately that this was a place meant for the assembly of gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the temple, numerous thrones were arranged in a circular formation. At the highest point, on the most magnificent and opulent throne, sat a languid youth. He rested his head on one hand, studying them with an amused expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Morax and Barbatos could puzzle over the unfamiliar figure on the throne, the youth spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Greetings, Morax, Barbatos, Baal, and Focalors. The former Heavenly Principle, Phanes, has perished. I am the new Heavenly Principle, Noah.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah smiled warmly as he addressed the four Archons standing in the Hall of Gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he spoke, the Primordial Law Ring materialized behind him in a radiant, seven-colored halo, exuding supreme authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Primordial Law Ring was the ultimate power governing all the laws of Teyvat, from which even the Archons themselves had been born as fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the Archons, the Heavenly Principle was an entity that could not be defied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The new Heavenly Principle! Phanes is dead?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revelation sent shockwaves through the minds of the four gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes. Phanes sacrificed herself to protect Teyvat after the Khaenri&#39;ah Cataclysm five hundred years ago. As the Fifth Descender, I inherited the Throne of Heavenly Principles and all of Phanes&#39; power upon my arrival in this world,&quot; Noah explained, smiling at their stunned faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then, do you summon us because you require our strength?&quot; Morax, the eldest of the Archons, was the first to recover from his shock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That explained everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phanes was gone, and the arrival of a new Heavenly Principle would inevitably bring either renewed vitality or disaster to Teyvat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Abyssal power that had once plagued the Sustainer was gone, indicating that the new Heavenly Principle possessed the ability to counter the Abyss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It made perfect sense that Phanes would have entrusted the Throne of the Heavens to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbatos exhaled a long sigh of relief. If there was a new Heavenly Principle, there was no chance of being held accountable for his past negligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t something that can be explained in a few words. Please, take your seats. We&#39;ll discuss this slowly&mdash;this concerns Teyvat&#39;s greatest matter of importance,&quot; Noah said with a snap of his fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A round table appeared in front of them, surrounded by five magnificent thrones. Each throne bore an elemental sigil corresponding to the respective Archon&#39;s identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday seated herself coolly beside Noah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If this is about Teyvat&#39;s most critical matters, you can count on me, Lord Noah! I&#39;ll give my all to the cause,&quot; Barbatos declared, patting his chest as he sat in his designated throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was clear that this new Heavenly Principle was different from Phanes, who had been distant and unfeeling. Flattery wouldn&#39;t cost him anything, and it might even smooth the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Lord Heavenly Principle, why didn&#39;t the other three Archons join us for this meeting?&quot; Barbatos asked with feigned innocence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Their nations&#39; current situations disqualify them from participating in this conference, so they were not summoned,&quot; Noah replied, a playful smile tugging at his lips as he observed Barbatos&#39; wide-eyed, &quot;innocent&quot; expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s exactly the tone I expected from you, Barbatos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to think of it, aren&#39;t wind spirits supposed to be genderless? They can take any form they wish... Something to research later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Barbatos replied, his heart sinking as he realized Noah had seen through him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, what exactly is this great matter that requires our presence? Can you explain in detail, Lord Heavenly Principle?&quot; Morax asked calmly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ei remained silent, like a soldier awaiting orders, while Focalors fidgeted nervously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Hydro Archon, she lacked the strength of her colleagues, and the gravity of the situation made her uneasy. Could she face a fate similar to her predecessor, Egeria?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Asmoday, share the information with them,&quot; Noah said, tapping the table lightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had already granted Asmoday administrative privileges over the Human Realm Force System, effectively making her a co-moderator in this divine assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the previous Heavenly Principle, who had used the three systems merely as tools to manage Teyvat, Noah saw their immense potential as the foundation of a self-sustaining divine order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was this vision that had inspired him to remodel Celestia into the Hall of Gods, paving the way for a future where his pantheon would outshine even the gods of Greek mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmoday transmitted the information, and the reactions were as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The calm and composed Morax, the carefree Barbatos, the reserved Ei, and the anxious Focalors all widened their eyes in shock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shock gave way to excitement, and excitement quickly turned to fervor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Devouring other worlds to perfect Teyvat! This power is simply unbelievable,&quot; Barbatos exclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Phanes, who had created Teyvat, was far from being in the same league as this new Heavenly Principle. The sheer magnitude of Noah&#39;s power was unimaginable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Indeed, this ability is nothing short of a divine blessing for Teyvat,&quot; Morax agreed, his respect for Noah deepening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, he had merely been awed by Noah&#39;s inheritance of Phanes&#39; power. Now, he felt genuine reverence for the vision Noah embodied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This vision&mdash;to break free from the false sky and explore the unknown&mdash;was what Teyvat&#39;s people had always yearned for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phanes had punished anyone who dared to pursue such ambitions, fearing the dangers of the unknown, such as forbidden knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you require my strength, use it as you see fit,&quot; Ei said, her pale violet eyes burning with fervor. Her hands trembled slightly from excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She saw in this plan a true chance to bring her sister back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teyvat lacked the power to resurrect her sister, but what about the other worlds? Surely, the answer lay somewhere among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am at your service as well,&quot; Focalors added, determined to contribute. As Fontaine&#39;s god, she had a duty to support Teyvat&#39;s advancement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, after proving her worth, she could ask Noah to solve Fontaine&#39;s unique predicament, transforming its people into true humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there was another way to save them, she wouldn&#39;t have to face death. And she feared death greatly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good. It seems everyone understands the importance of this matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah smiled as he tapped his finger rhythmically against the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plan to strengthen Teyvat on such a massive scale was irresistible&mdash;only traitors and fools would object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits were undeniable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, to ensure the success of this plan and to allow you to fully dedicate yourselves to this grand endeavor, I will adjust Teyvat&#39;s laws and provide you with assistance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The first measure I&#39;m implementing is to lift the erosion that affects all life in Teyvat. If we want this world to ascend into a stronger existence, the stronger its inhabitants become, the greater the benefits to the world itself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah announced this decision with resolute authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lifting Erosion!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ancient Archons&mdash;Morax, Barbatos, and Ei&mdash;this proclamation sent a jolt of excitement through their spirits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To them, Erosion was the greatest enemy, an affliction that had plagued them for eons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Erosion was a rule set by Phanes to maintain the balance of Teyvat. Since Teyvat is a finite world, it couldn&#39;t possibly sustain the resources required for its gods to grow indefinitely. The longer gods existed at their peak, the more resources they consumed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s why Phanes created the rule of erosion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But now that I&#39;ve become the Heavenly Principle, this rule is no longer suitable for Teyvat. Instead, it&#39;s detrimental and must be abolished.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah continued, explaining the logic behind his decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erosion, in essence, was a desperate measure born of Teyvat&#39;s inability to sustain itself. Phanes had no way to increase the world&#39;s resources, so limiting their depletion was the only option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Noah finished speaking, the Primordial Law Ring behind him emitted a dazzling light, and the rule of erosion was erased from Teyvat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is incredible!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbatos was so overjoyed that he nearly burst into song. Erosion had tormented him endlessly, and another five centuries under its grip would have left even his soul in tatters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it had been this unbearable for him, the oldest Archon, Morax, must have suffered even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Barbatos had little interest in increasing his strength, he valued his memories and sanity dearly&mdash;they were irreplaceable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment the rule of erosion was lifted, Morax felt an immense weight leave his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though his strength hadn&#39;t fully returned yet, it was only a matter of time before he was restored to his prime. Without erosion, beings like Azhdaha and the Yakshas could also return to their former selves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax&#39;s gratitude toward the new Heavenly Principle grew immeasurably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now then, you all understand the importance of those three worlds to Teyvat. You&#39;re also familiar with the plans for annexing them. Let&#39;s discuss who will carry out these tasks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah leaned forward, resting his chin on his hands, radiating the aura of a decisive leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could have issued direct orders, but that would have been boring. He wasn&#39;t interested in playing a single-player game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, his actual age didn&#39;t come close to even a fraction of the youngest Archon, Focalors. While his modern, Earthly perspective gave him a broad outlook, he lacked deep expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it came to practical matters, the Archons were far more capable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As their &quot;big boss,&quot; his role was to outline plans and let the competent people execute them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well&hellip; what do you think, old man?&quot; Barbatos glanced at Morax, clearly reluctant to be the first to step up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annexing another world was an enormous task, fraught with unpredictable challenges. Barbatos preferred to let someone else take the lead, then learn from their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax shot Barbatos a calm look before speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I believe we should annex these worlds in order of strength, starting with the weakest. Teyvat is already riddled with vulnerabilities, and annexing a stronger world could take too much time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are short on time above all else. A weaker world like Demon Slayer&#39;s world can be annexed quickly, providing Teyvat with at least a few hundred more years of stability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That span of time would be sufficient to annex the other, stronger worlds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re absolutely right, old man. I was thinking the same thing. And, between the three of us, Inazuma is the best fit to execute the plan,&quot; Barbatos added, shifting his gaze toward Ei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Ei asked, puzzled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focalors tilted her head at Ei&#39;s confusion. &quot;Because Inazuma&#39;s culture aligns closely with that world&#39;s beliefs. It would be much easier for Inazuma to replace the gods in their myths and establish its authority there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could such an obvious point elude an Archon as old as Ei?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is that so? Very well, I&#39;ll take charge of the Demon Slayer world,&quot; Ei agreed, though her heart was filled with unease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with detailed plans in place, she wasn&#39;t sure how to portray a god in another world&#39;s mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If only my sister were here. She would know exactly what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Ei thought, Yae Miko was clever enough. Entrusting this to her would surely yield results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you need help, just say the word. After all, this concerns the survival of Teyvat,&quot; Morax offered, noticing Ei&#39;s furrowed brow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly. This is a critical step for the future of our world,&quot; Barbatos added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was an unprecedentedly important endeavor for Teyvat. Even if Inazuma spearheaded the operation, none of them could afford to let their guard down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now that we&#39;ve made our decision, today&#39;s meeting is adjourned. We&#39;ll reconvene to discuss the other two worlds once the first is annexed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah announced, his tone leaving no room for doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Meeting dismissed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as Barbatos left Celestia, he turned eagerly to Morax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Old man, do you think I&#39;m dreaming? This all feels so unreal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Shall I help you wake up, Barbatos?&quot; Morax asked, lifting his hand in mock seriousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, no, no! My delicate frame can&#39;t handle one of your slaps, old man,&quot; Barbatos replied, wiping nonexistent sweat from his brow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This world has undergone a profound change,&quot; Morax said, glancing back at Celestia with a sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed his plans to relinquish his role as Geo Archon and hand over Liyue&#39;s governance to its people would have to be abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Heavenly Principle would never permit such a move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weight of his responsibilities had grown even heavier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With a new Heavenly Principle in place, of course the world has changed,&quot; Barbatos quipped with a wink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, old man, I&#39;m off to Mondstadt to handle my affairs. Until we meet again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, Barbatos vanished into a gust of wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Mondstadt&#39;s people still revered him, he had largely neglected his duties as their Archon for two thousand years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizing them to participate in the Heavenly Principle&#39;s plan to annex other worlds would be no small challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax, however, had a much stronger foundation to rely on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the powerful Adepti and Yakshas at his disposal, and the deeply ingrained traditions of the Rite of Descension, Liyue&#39;s alliance between the Archon and the Qixing was rock solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morax could likely annex even a world as strong as the Inuyasha world in a relatively short time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in Liyue, Morax returned to Mt. Aocang, taking a seat at the stone table outside Cloud Retainer&#39;s domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Rex Lapis, you&#39;ve arrived,&quot; said a woman dressed in green robes and red-framed glasses, her graceful figure stepping from the shadows of the cave</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cloud Retainer, I have a matter of great importance to discuss. Summon all the Adepti, Yakshas, and the leaders of the Qixing and Eight Trades here for a meeting,&quot; Morax ordered, his expression grave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud Retainer blinked in surprise. &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inazuma</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tenshukaku, Ei sat tensely as she watched a young man stride into the palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had barely returned from Celestia and begun summoning her retainers when the new Heavenly Principle arrived in Inazuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lord Heavenly Principle, what brings you here?&quot; Ei asked nervously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No need to be so tense,&quot; Noah said with a laugh, clearly amused by her expression. &quot;Though I am the Heavenly Principle, I&#39;ve only just arrived in Teyvat. Isn&#39;t it perfectly reasonable for me to travel around and experience its culture?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His playful tone made Ei relax slightly, though she still found herself unsettled by the disarming smile on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife&#39;s awkward reactions are just too cute, Noah thought, suppressing another chuckle.</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:22:35', '2025-04-16 05:22:35');

Naturally, his subordinates would feel the pressure of their &quot;boss&quot; personally visiting their domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the tension was Ei&#39;s glaring flaw&mdash;she wasn&#39;t exactly the sharpest when it came to governance. If it was about charging into battle, she could obliterate anything in her path. But running a nation? She was hopeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could almost see her returning to Inazuma and throwing the responsibility onto the Tri-Commission without a second thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wouldn&#39;t do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Yashiro Commission under Kamisato Ayato might still be useful, but the Kanjou Commission and Tenryou Commission had long since rotted to the core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If those corrupted officials were allowed to get involved, the Demon Slayer world would undoubtedly be ravaged beyond recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were people who exploited Inazuma&#39;s own citizens without remorse. They wouldn&#39;t hesitate to do the same to the people of another world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, what are your preparations for the plan?&quot; Noah asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was going to summon the leaders of the Three Commissions, the Shuumatsuban, and the Grand Narukami Shrine to Tenshukaku to discuss the execution of the plan,&quot; Ei replied without hesitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As I thought&hellip;&quot; Noah sighed. &quot;Good thing I came along. Otherwise, you would&#39;ve ruined the first world-annexation plan entirely.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Ei blinked in confusion, her face blank as she struggled to understand his criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you think Inazuma has remained as prosperous as you imagine since you sealed yourself away and left everything to the Shogun?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind Noah, the Primordial Law Ring materialized, its light radiating authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You underestimate the greed of humans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gods like us can exist for eternity, and five centuries are but a fleeting moment. But mortals? They only live for a few decades. Perhaps the first generation of nobles who held power governed responsibly under the Shogun&#39;s oversight. But as time passed, and generations of officials tasted the sweetness of authority, they rotted from within.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&#39;ve mastered the art of deception, presenting Inazuma as a land of eternal stability while twisting the truth to serve their own ends. They&#39;ve even turned the Shogun into a tool for maintaining their dominance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you let them participate in the plan, it&#39;s guaranteed to fail. And with that failure, Teyvat will lose its one chance to reverse its decline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The golden light of the Primordial Law Ring intensified as Noah&#39;s gaze turned stern, his eyes glowing with divine authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s impossible. The Three Commissions have always governed impartially, and I have personally reviewed every report submitted to my desk. Under my leadership, Inazuma has been at peace, and the people are living fulfilling lives,&quot; the Raiden Shogun&#39;s voice took over, her tone solemn and unwavering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Peace and prosperity? Then take a good look at what&#39;s truly been happening in Inazuma over the past five centuries. Compare it to the idyllic image those officials have painted for you,&quot; Noah replied, his tone laced with faint amusement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a wave of his hand, the Primordial Law Ring emitted seven-colored light, activating the power of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scenes from Inazuma&#39;s past five centuries materialized before Ei and the Raiden Shogun, playing like a movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Ruler of Time, Istaroth, had not been seen for ages&mdash;even Noah didn&#39;t know which fragment of time she now slumbered in&mdash;the power of time had largely been reclaimed by Phanes before her demise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it was Noah&#39;s to command.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the power of time in Teyvat had limits. It could not rewrite history, rewind time, or access the future. At most, it could slightly alter the course of minor events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display showed the gradual decline of Inazuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first century under the Shogun&#39;s rule, the Three Commissions had performed admirably. But after that, greed seeped into their ranks. By the second century, they had begun seizing wealth from the commoners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the fourth century, the situation had spiraled out of control. The Commissions ruthlessly confiscated land, manipulated food prices, and left Inazuma&#39;s citizens starving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final fifty years, the rot had reached its peak. The Commissions had allied with the Fatui, exploiting the populace with impunity. They even neglected vital duties such as maintaining the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual that anchored the Ley Lines and suppressed corrupted remnants, allowing calamities to spread unchecked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worst of all, they sold materials meant for the Mikage Furnace, leading to its collapse. As a result, the once-fertile lands of Tatarasuna were poisoned, becoming uninhabitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching these scenes unfold, Ei and the Raiden Shogun could no longer deny the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Raiden Shogun, normally composed, now trembled with rage. The divine fury of a god caused the skies above Narukami Island to darken, black clouds roiling and thunder crashing violently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Inazuma City paused to glance up, startled for a moment before returning to their routines. Such tempests were common in their land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the truth kept coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corrupted officials, fearing threats to their power from outside influences, had falsified reports and manipulated the Shogun into issuing the Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time the scenes concluded, Ei was shaking with anger. She wanted nothing more than to march out and obliterate the deceitful officials who had poisoned her land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the revelations didn&#39;t stop there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fatui&#39;s manipulations had incited war between the Tenryou Commission and Watatsumi Island, spreading chaos across the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worse, the corruption had led to the destruction of the Narukami Pillars on Yashiori Island, unleashing the cursed remnants of Orobashi. The island&#39;s people had been driven to madness, infected by the Tatarigami, and died in droves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when disaster struck, the Tenryou Commission prioritized covering up their negligence rather than aiding the people. They slaughtered fleeing villagers, blaming their deaths on Watatsumi rebels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final scene froze on the Tenryou Commissioner, Takayuki Kujou, presenting a falsified report to the Shogun just days ago, claiming Inazuma was a land of peace and prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bitter irony was palpable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now, Ei was trembling uncontrollably. Her divine will swept across Inazuma, revealing the true state of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Far from a land of peace, it was riddled with suffering. Beyond the capital, fields were littered with corpses, Ley Lines were in disarray, and corrupted entities roamed unchecked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her people resented her deeply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast, the corrupt officials indulged in every conceivable luxury, exploiting the people for their own gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you know why I summoned only four Archons to the assembly at Celestia?&quot; Noah asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because their nations are in even worse condition than yours. In Sumeru, the ruling class has imprisoned their god. In Snezhnaya, Tsaritsa has been reduced to a puppet of the Fatui.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His voice softened slightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it were Phanes, she would have already sent a Divine Nail to obliterate Inazuma. If the Ley Lines destabilized, the entire nation would have been doomed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re lucky. All Inazuma needs is for those corrupt officials to be dealt with, and the nation can be set back on the right path. Compared to Sumeru and Snezhnaya, your task is far simpler.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s why I allowed you to join the assembly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inazuma&#39;s upper echelons may have rotted extensively, but for Ei, this wasn&#39;t an insurmountable problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With her divine authority, she could single-handedly set Inazuma back on the right path. In Inazuma, the word of the god was absolute, beyond question or challeng</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Ei still had dependable forces&mdash;the Yashiro Commission, Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission, the Grand Narukami Shrine, and the Shuumatsuban&mdash;all of which would unquestionably obey her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, look at Sumeru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five hundred years had passed, and Noah didn&#39;t believe for a second that the sages of the Akademiya hadn&#39;t realized their god was imprisoned. Yet not a single soul had stood up for five centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Alhaitham&#39;s rescue of the Dendro Archon wasn&#39;t born of duty to Sumeru; it was merely because his own life had been inconvenienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sumeru was a nation thoroughly rotten from top to bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Inner self, I&#39;m going to kill them. I&#39;ll cut down all these vermin. They are the enemies of eternity,&quot; Raiden Shogun growled, her murderous intent surging as she reached for her naginata, ready to annihilate the deceitful officials who had mocked and betrayed her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Killing them outright is too merciful,&quot; Noah interjected, golden light gleaming in his eyes as the authority of the Primordial Law Ring stopped the enraged Shogun in her tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a ruler, you must announce your will to the people of Inazuma and publicly pass judgment on these vermin. Only then will you dispel the resentment of the people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noah&#39;s gaze sharpened. Slaying a few corrupt officials wouldn&#39;t solve the problem. Entire families would need to be purged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would be the point of executing Takayuki Kujou if another Kujou heir stepped in to perpetuate the cycle of oppression?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such hereditary privilege was absurd. Just because the Kujou clan had fought alongside Ei in the past didn&#39;t mean they deserved eternal prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I suggest you consult your trusted retainer. She will provide valuable advice. Additionally, summon the head of the Yashiro Commission. After purging the corruption, he can address the pressing needs of the common people and guide Inazuma back on track.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once Inazuma stabilizes, I&#39;ll establish the gateway to the Demon Slayer world at the Grand Narukami Shrine,&quot; Noah added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the chaotic Ley Lines, rampant corruption, and corrupted remnants plaguing Inazuma, these issues would naturally resolve themselves once Teyvat&#39;s capacity grew through the annexation of the Demon Slayer world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yae Miko? She&#39;s been clever since she was young,&quot; Ei said, nodding as she suppressed her killing intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, a wave of gratitude welled up within her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the former Heavenly Principle, this new one wasn&#39;t cold and ruthless. If it had been Phanes, Inazuma would have been struck with a Divine Nail for her negligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Inazuma was overrun with malevolence, its Ley Lines unstable, its people starving&mdash;all failures of her divine stewardship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though she despised the corrupt nobles, she felt overwhelming guilt for her people&#39;s suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kamisato Estate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tea Room</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lady Guuji said there&#39;s a potential disaster looming over Inazuma. She wants the Kamisato Clan to prepare to evacuate some citizens&hellip;&quot; Kamisato Ayato said, frowning as he regarded the unexpected visitor sitting across from him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Though I greatly respect her foresight, I find such a vague explanation difficult to comprehend. Furthermore, with the Shogun&#39;s storms blanketing the entire nation, it would be impossible to evacuate anyone from Inazuma, even if we tried.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayato&#39;s tone was measured, but his confusion was evident. As a Guuji, Yae Miko was astute and enigmatic, never one to speak carelessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what kind of disaster could warrant such an action?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did she suspect Liyue or Mondstadt might attack Inazuma? That seemed far-fetched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah, such a headache. Even I can&#39;t figure it out,&quot; Yae Miko sighed dramatically, resting her chin in her hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She couldn&#39;t exactly tell Ayato she suspected their &quot;country bumpkin&quot; god had gone mad from erosion and stormed Celestia, could she?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lady Guuji, what exactly is troubling you? If it&#39;s something I can handle, I&#39;ll do everything in my power,&quot; Ayato offered sincerely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yae Miko shook her head. Even if she explained, there was no way Ayato could deal with it. Perhaps she was overthinking things. Maybe Celestia had summoned Ei for some other reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Forget it. Let&#39;s just consider it my overactive imagination. Don&#39;t trouble yourself, Kamisato boy,&quot; she said, waving a hand dismissively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Ayato bowed politely, Miko thought to herself how increasingly difficult it was to connect with him. Though his manners were impeccable, his mind was calculating and overly guarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Yae Miko rose to leave, Ei&#39;s voice resonated through the tea room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Miko, come to Tenshukaku. Bring the head of the Yashiro Commission with you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing the summons, Yae Miko&#39;s expression shifted, her earlier worries melting away, replaced with excitement tinged with a hint of indignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ei, you finally remembered me? You&#39;ve been hiding behind the Shogun, leaving all your affairs unattended. If I&#39;d died, would you have even noticed?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that time, she could count on her fingers how many times she&#39;d seen Ei. Worse, the Raiden Shogun, with her wooden demeanor, was incapable of steering Inazuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nation had devolved into chaos, but what could she do? Storm Tenshukaku and teach the Shogun how to govern? She was just a fox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve worked hard, Miko. We&#39;ll talk more when you get here,&quot; Ei said, a trace of guilt in her voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the glimpses of the past that Noah had shown her, Ei had seen how tirelessly Miko worked to suppress Ley Line disturbances and corrupted forces on Narukami Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was thanks to Miko&#39;s efforts that Narukami Island was in better shape than the rest of Inazuma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll come. But I bet you&#39;ll just give me a few orders and then disappear again,&quot; Miko replied, her tone dripping with mock grievance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all of Inazuma, only Yae Miko dared to speak to a god in such a manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kamisato Ayato, ever the picture of composure, closed his eyes and did his best impression of a wooden statue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stop pretending to be furniture, Kamisato boy. Come with me to Tenshukaku,&quot; Miko said as she turned gracefully and left the tea room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, Lady Guuji,&quot; Ayato replied, standing to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though he prided himself on remaining calm in any situation, being summoned by the Shogun herself left him undeniably tense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his frequent dealings with the Shogun on official matters, a personal summons carried an entirely different weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could the Shogun possibly want from him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Yae Miko and Kamisato Ayato arrived at Tenshukaku, they were greeted by an unusual sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Raiden Shogun knelt at her desk, reviewing reports submitted by the Tenryou and Kanjou Commissions, her expression as cold as ice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside her sat a young man with an air of mystery, casually flipping through the very documents that were supposed to be seen by the Shogun alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miko and Ayato were both shocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To browse such sensitive materials so nonchalantly was not just bold&mdash;it bordered on sacrilege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the Shogun didn&#39;t seem to mind. She showed no displeasure whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More astonishingly, the young man appeared completely at ease in her presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was he to behave so audaciously?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shogun raised her gaze, meeting theirs. Though her anger simmered beneath the surface, she suppressed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Miko. Kamisato Ayato. You&#39;ve arrived,&quot; she said evenly.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:23:06', '2025-04-16 05:23:06'),

He was a full-time, impoverished scholar whose family survived on his father&#39;s hunting, leading a barely acceptable life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until half a year ago, after his father set off for the mountains at night, he never returned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the loss of the family&#39;s pillar and the failure of the original inhabitant&#39;s child exam, the double blow led to a serious illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s when Chen Sansi transmigrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah, Brother Shi, you&#39;re awake!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A woman, carrying a bowl of medicinal soup, entered the house. She was overjoyed to see the young man waking up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She hurried to the bedside, her already ill-fitting garment shaking violently as she ran, as if there were two rabbits tumbling inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This woman was named Gu Xinlan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was a child bride bought by the original inhabitant&#39;s father when he was very young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had always taken care of the original inhabitant like an elder sister, staying loyal even after his father&#39;s death and through his illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original inhabitant seemed to have looked down on this sister quite a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being the descendant of criminals, she was sent to the frontier and nearly sold to a brothel, making her the lowest of the low class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering himself far superior, the original inhabitant had believed he would one day pass the exams and marry a well-to-do woman, becoming a successful man. He thought she wasn&#39;t good enough for him and treated her like a servant on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi, how are you feeling?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan sat down by the bed and placed her hand on the young man&#39;s forehead, exclaiming with surprise, &quot;The fever&#39;s gone?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi sat up and tried to move his body. Aside from some weakness, there was nothing seriously wrong with him, as the illness had disappeared with his transmigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Truly the blessing of the gods.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan was visibly relieved, &quot;Brother Shi, you drink your medicine first, I&#39;ll go fix you some food.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching her walk away, her tortoise-like hips ready to burst from her clothing, Chen Sansi spent ten minutes digesting his current situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since I&#39;m here, I might as well make the best of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&#39;d always been quick to adapt to his environment. Since he&#39;d come to this world, he needed to figure out how to live well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He picked up the bitter medicinal soup and drank it all at once, then went to the next room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He saw Gu Xinlan almost entirely inside the rice bin, just her hips stuck out, as she struggled to scoop out some grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After much effort, she managed to gather a small handful of millet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the death of the original inhabitant&#39;s father, the family had lost its source of income. Moreover, the original inhabitant&#39;s recent illness had completely depleted their savings, bringing them to the brink of utter destitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just now, was that the tax collector for the autumn taxes?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi stood behind Sister Lan, &quot;How much do they want?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Three taels of silver,&quot; Gu Xinlan replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Three taels?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi inhaled sharply, &quot;Are they including father in the count?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan nodded gently, &quot;The petty official said that since they hadn&#39;t found father&#39;s body, he couldn&#39;t be declared dead and his registration couldn&#39;t be canceled. We still have to pay the full tax, including the hunting tax too.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi cursed inwardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oppressive taxes of the Dasheng Dynasty were severe, and with frequent wars in recent years, the taxes had only increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi, don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worry was evident in Gu Xinlan&#39;s eyes, though she tried to reassure him, &quot;I&#39;ve recently got some work at a tailor&#39;s shop and, along with doing laundry for people, we should be able to scrape together something.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, the original inhabitant was completely financially dependent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after his father&#39;s death, he was reluctant to seek another livelihood and preferred to have Sister Lan work herself to the bone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not even considering whether he was cut out for it...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi felt rather speechless, he couldn&#39;t even pass the exam to become a Scholar, yet he was still dreaming of one day passing the imperial examination&mdash;wasn&#39;t that the talk of a delusional person?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could no longer continue this way; he needed to find a means of making a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, if he couldn&#39;t pay the taxes, the men would be sent away for forced labor, and the women would be sold into brothels&mdash;a fate worse than death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll go cook rice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan busied herself with the task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, the meal was prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two bowls of a staple food made from a mixture of millet and chaff, not even pickled vegetables were served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was probably the last bit of grain in the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi noticed that his bowl had a higher proportion of millet compared to Gu Xinlan&#39;s, which was mostly chaff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaff, which was the husk of grains such as rice, wheat, and soybeans, was rough and difficult to swallow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the modern age, it was essentially used as livestock fodder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eat, Brother Shi.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan picked up her chopsticks and ate with small, deliberate bites, her fingers visibly red and swollen, the joints showing small sores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the result of washing too many clothes for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a woman, she did everything she could to provide for the family, short of the backbreaking labor only men could do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi saw this and remembered it, his head bent as he ate the hard-to-swallow chaff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Midway through the meal, Gu Xinlan put down her chopsticks and hesitantly spoke, &quot;Actually, aside from the tax silver, we still owe Aunt Li two coins for medical expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Otherwise... I&#39;m just suggesting, if you could just recover a bit more, maybe you could also find some work to do? If we can&#39;t gather enough silver for the tax by the end of the month, I heard they&#39;ll take people away...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she spoke, she quietly watched his expression, her fingers anxiously picking at the corner of her clothes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time this matter was brought up before, Brother Shi would fly into a rage, saying things like how a scholar shouldn&#39;t engage in menial labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eat your food,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi shoveled the food into his mouth quietly pondering his finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan didn&#39;t dare to bring it up again, she quietly finished her meal, swiftly washed the pots and pans, and hurried off to her work as a female laborer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi remained seated, deeply considering his options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ancient times were not like modern society, where mere physical strength could find you work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His family owned no land, and without any academic title from his studies, the only thing left to do was to hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a child, he had learned a few tricks from his father, and although he had let his skills atrophy over the years, he still had the basic foundations; it shouldn&#39;t be hard to get started again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, since he had to pay hunting tax anyway, he might as well hunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house still had an old bow left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi went to the inner room and took down the longbow covered in dust from the wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It should still be usable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But I have a bow with no arrows; I need to find a way to get some money to buy arrows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to survive, the household had sold nearly all of its books, leaving only the &quot;Four Treasures of the Study&quot; which the original owner valued as his life, as possibly the last things of some value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without any hesitation, Chen Sansi packed up the writing brush, ink, paper, and inkstone and took them away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though they were all low-grade items, they sold for a total of two hundred copper coins, roughly equivalent to two silver coins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough to show that &quot;poor scholars and rich warriors&quot; was not an absolute, studying was also an expensive endeavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the money in hand, Chen Sansi went to the market stall that catered to hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Little Shi, you&#39;re here to buy arrows?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stall owner Uncle Xu was from a military household and an old acquaintance of Shi&#39;s father: &quot;Are you preparing to hunt in the mountains instead of studying?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m looking to buy a few old arrows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi picked out five second-hand willow leaf arrows from the stall: &quot;How much?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Seventy coins.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi bargained, &quot;Uncle Xu, old arrows aren&#39;t worth that much. Fifty coins at most.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, fifty coins it is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Yu was straightforward: &quot;I say, you should&#39;ve gone to the mountains a long time ago, learned a fair amount of your father&#39;s skills, at least enough to make ends meet. But instead, you insisted on reading useless books. Do you think a kid from a poor family like yours could become an official?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Uncle speaks the truth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi didn&#39;t argue, and after making sure the arrows had no quality issues, he strung them on the bowstring and aimed at the ground to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, several lines of small characters appeared before his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Skill: Archery (Entry-Level)]</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:24:09', '2025-04-16 05:24:09'),

a bow and arrow, he wasn&#39;t very confident about hitting the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, hunting is a skill-based activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it was so easy, everyone would already be eating meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now, with the added capabilities, the situation was drastically different!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What are you dazing for, is there a problem with the

say more, paid the copper coin, took his things, and immediately left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He carried his bow and arrows, walking and stopping, heading straight to the foot of Tiger Head Mountain located about ten miles away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mountain was the nearest place in Po Yang County with game, and it was also the livelihood of many hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi had just recovered from a serious illness and had walked such a long way, so he was gasping for breath, sitting on a rock for quite a while before he recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He carefully examined the bow and arrows left by his father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From its construction, it was a typical recurve bow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bow core was made of bamboo, the bow was made of willow wood, the bow was made of sturdy wood, and the

progress, and upon completing the progress, he would certainly break through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In this way, as long as I practice hard, won&#39;t I have the chance to become the best Divine Archer in the entire Po Yang County?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi&#39;s heart suddenly filled with hope, remembering the tips his father had taught him when he was young, and he slowly raised the bow and arrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is a forty-pound bow this heavy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He struggled to draw the bow to its full extent, almost gnashing his teeth to do so, and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of people were mentioned in legends who could open a stone-bow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stand straight and steady, exert even force, grip the bow correctly, mount the arrow calmly, push forward and step back, and complete the bow-drawing pose.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muttering the formula in his heart, Chen Sansi stood up straight, drew the bow and mounted the arrow, facing a tree trunk about forty meters away with the thickness of a hug, pushed the bow forward with his left palm, pulled the bowstring with three fingers of his right hand, slightly aimed the arrowhead downward, and then released the arrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Swoosh&mdash;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arrow flew off, missing the target, and hit another tree&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi was not discouraged, and immediately took another arrow from the Arrow Bag, aimed at the target, and shot another arrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, the arrow went directly into the grass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Again!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi shot five times in a row and finally hit the tree trunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He carefully approached and pulled the arrows out of the tree trunk, repeating the previous actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several repetitions, he summarized the regularity for improving the archery progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as he shot an arrow wholeheartedly, whether it hit the target or not, he could improve his proficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he was not focused enough, it would not work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, hitting the target resulted in greater progress improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After shooting over sixty arrows, Chen Sansi began to feel cramps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His body was originally weak, and combined with malnutrition, being able to shoot so many times consecutively was already quite an accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, with each arrow shot, his proficiency increased, and the more he shot, the more accurate he became, rarely missing at a distance of twenty steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Skill: Archery (Entry-level)&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Progress: (70/100)&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Utility: None&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry-level was not far away, but Chen Sansi had hardly any energy left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After resting for a while, he began to wander in the woods with his bow and arrow, trying to see if he could hunt some meat to eat with the remaining energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this area was too close to the town, and the easy-to-catch game was basically all gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wandered until the evening before he found a few wild pigeons, but they were too far away to hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the past life, I always came back empty-handed from fishing, and now I&#39;m empty-handed from hunting too?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t completely in vain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before leaving the mountains, Chen Sansi found a patch of wild shepherd&#39;s purse, quickly dug it up by hand, and stuffed it into his chest pocket before heading down the mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his way, he went to the market and learned that the price of grain had gone up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to consecutive poor harvests, the price of rice in Po Yang County had soared to one hundred copper coins per bushel, and the price of meat was even more outrageously expensive, with a pound of pork costing seventeen copper coins. Add to that oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, firewood, charcoal, candles, and various excessive taxes&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi couldn&#39;t imagine how many common people would not survive this winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimating that the prices of grains would continue to rise, he decided to spend all the remaining copper coins on buying rice and mixed grains along with a few salted duck eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One bushel of rice, half a bushel of mixed grains, in total is only enough to feed two people for three to five days. If I exchanged it all for sorghum mixed with bran, it might last a few more days.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Chen Sansi had no choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since he was going to become a hunter in the future, he absolutely couldn&#39;t continue eating nutrition-less bran; he needed to ensure he had enough physical strength at all times, otherwise, if he encountered any danger in the mountains, he wouldn&#39;t even have the energy to run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was already starving, and after getting the grains, he hastened his steps, eager to get home and start cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yo, Little Stone!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he was about to reach his doorstep, someone suddenly called his name from behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi turned around, and a tall, burly man appeared in front of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qin Xiong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well-known bully in the town, he had a group of thugs under him and made money by charging high-interest loans and trafficking virtuous women; many impoverished people in the town had been ruined by him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wow, bow and arrow?!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qin Xiong eyed the bow and arrows behind Chen Sansi with surprise mixed with mockery: &quot;This &#39;Scholar&#39; also plans to learn to hunt in the mountains?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Driven by necessity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi stepped back half a step and said, &quot;Brother Qin, did you want to see me for something?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qin Xiong hooked the corner of his mouth, &quot;How have you considered the matter from last time?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sudden dread struck Chen Sansi&#39;s heart, and unpleasant memories flooded his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half a year ago, after his father had passed away, the household had become extremely strapped for cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It just so happened that Qin Xiong came knocking, and the former owner had thought about selling Gu Xinlan for money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it were him, naturally, he would never do such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Qin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi refused, &quot;I&#39;ve thought it over, I won&#39;t be needing your money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon hearing this, Qin Xiong&#39;s face immediately darkened, &quot;Are you sure you&#39;ve thought it through?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really don&#39;t need it, Brother Qin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi held his sack of grain tightly and took a detour on his way home, feeling somewhat uneasy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his memory, Qin Xiong was not someone who would easily let things go, and he feared this matter was far from over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly, good fortunes never come in pairs, and misfortunes never come singly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hadn&#39;t even sorted out his meals, and now a bully had targeted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi touched the arrow bag at his waist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bow and five arrows were his greatest reassurance living at the bottom of this chaotic world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&#39;t know what changes would follow after progressing past the entry-level of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I need to fill my stomach first to have the energy to practice archery!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi pushed open his home&#39;s door, only to find Sister Lan had not yet returned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day, she was busy laboring, sewing in the tailor shop in the morning and washing clothes for the wealthy families in the afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took the initiative to chop wood and start a fire, preparing the meal in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plain rice served with salted duck eggs, and a soup of boiled wild greens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many households, this was already a decent meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Gu Xinlan returned home after her busy day, for the first time ever, she was surprised by the steaming ready-made meal: &quot;Brother Shi, where did the white rice and salted duck eggs come from at home?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi beckoned her to sit down, then grabbed the chopsticks and wolfed down the food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had been starving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi had his head down eating away, when he finally noticed that Gu Xinlan hadn&#39;t touched her chopsticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her eyes had reddened unknowingly, and tears trembled on her lashes as she choked up and said, &quot;Can you... not sell me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi was stunned and a bit confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I heard people say that you made a deal with that Qin Xiong today&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan&#39;s voice trembled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, where would the silver to buy white rice and even salted duck eggs come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She frantically pulled out a patched-up purse from her waist, poured out a few copper coins, and pleaded, &quot;Brother Shi, I was wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I won&#39;t urge you to work anymore, just stay at home and study, I can earn money, I can pay the taxes, please don&#39;t sell me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone in Po Yang County knew of Qin Xiong&#39;s reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landing in his hands, she was likely to be sold to a brothel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason Gu Xinlan had faithfully stayed with the Chen Family all these years was precisely because Chen Sansi&#39;s father had bought her from a trafficker, preventing her from becoming a prostitute, and thus she remained grateful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was she really unable to escape this miserable fate in the end?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sister Lan, you&#39;re overthinking it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi understood, guessing that someone had been spreading rumours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He comforted her, &quot;You are a member of the Chen family, how could I possibly sell you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having someone around who was as intimate as a sister was incredibly valuable to someone new like himself; he would never push her away, or else wouldn&#39;t that be terribly disgraceful?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan didn&#39;t make a sound, she just sat there sobbing, obviously not convinced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi was helpless, he grabbed her swollen hand and led her into the inner room: &quot;The food was bought with the money from selling my books, not from Qin Xiong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan saw the empty book desk and a bow and arrow hanging on the wall, and was stunned, &quot;Brother Shi, you sold all the scholar&#39;s four jewels for a bow and arrows?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi patiently explained, &quot;From now on, I plan to follow father&#39;s footsteps, hunting to support the family, how can I let a woman like you suffer so much, your hands are even chapped.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To support the family&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan never thought she would hear Brother Shi say these words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She realized her decaying hand was still being held by him, feeling somewhat inferior, she tried to pull it back, but instead was embraced tightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Rest assured!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi, seeing her severe insecurity, spoke solemnly, &quot;Father once said, you were to be my wife, why would I send my wife away?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan was startled by the sudden embrace, feeling the warmth, she looked up incredulously at him, &quot;Brother Shi, you... you don&#39;t mind that I am of low status?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi affirmed, &quot;I can&#39;t like you enough.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi, you are all the family I have left in this world, don&#39;t deceive me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan no longer tried to escape, but after a few tests, finally rested her cheek against his chest, feeling this rare warmth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sister Lan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I feel a bit sore today, let&#39;s go to bed, can you give me a massage?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah...

He couldn&#39;t fathom why his former self had failed to cherish her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his previous life, she wouldn&#39;t be his to marry without at least two million!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi tiptoed out of bed and grabbed the bow and arrows from the wall before heading outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whoo&mdash;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took several deep breaths to calm his cluttered thoughts and aimed at a crooked willow tree to start practicing Archery with focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After resting for half the night, his spirits and Qi Power were almost fully restored, and his aim was quite impressive as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within twenty steps, he could nearly hit the target with every shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To minimize wear and tear, he practiced with only one arrow, yet even so, it was severely worn by the end of the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan peeped through the paper-covered window at Chen Sansi, drenched in sweat, and inexplicably felt relieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi is serious...

Indeed, his accuracy doubled; he hit every target within forty steps, and even those over sixty steps away were not bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this level of skill, he could definitely hit game animals!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most crucial point was, this was just the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi dared not imagine what it would be like if his archery skills reached small achievement or great success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Shi, dinner is ready~&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A soft, bone-melting voice came from inside the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi then put away his bow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He saw that although only one night had passed, Sister Lan had changed dramatically, exuding an indescribable charm along with her almond eyes, drawing extra attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the dining table, there were two bowls of rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One bowl contained rice with steamed buns; the other held half a bowl of thin porridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grain bought with a single silver coin couldn&#39;t last more than a few days, and clearly, Gu Xinlan was still reluctant to eat her fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi wasn&#39;t fussy, either. His archery practice consumed a lot of energy, and he needed even more since he was about to head up the mountain; after giving Sister Lan half a steamed bun, he ate everything else left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full and content, he slung his bow over his shoulder and stepped outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Be careful, Brother Shi, even if you don&#39;t catch anything, don&#39;t go too deep. Just gather some wild vegetables and firewood to bring back,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gu Xinlan did not believe that her man could catch any game just after beginning to practice archery; safety always came first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as they could overcome the current hardship together, she was willing to work herself to the bone even if Brother Shi wanted to leave his job to study in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Chen Sansi left his house, the day was already bright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neighbors were all starting their busy day; many looked on in curiosity at the sight of him carrying a bow and arrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, is Brother Shi preparing to go hunting up the mountain?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Can he do it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look, I told you early on, he can&#39;t make sense of books!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Go to hell, Lai Zi, at least he knows how to hunt. What can you do?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Little Shi, do you need Uncle Zhao to accompany you for a couple of days?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Be careful. Your family is depending on you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The villagers had their fair share of snide remarks, but thanks to his father&#39;s good reputation, the majority were warm-hearted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen Sansi greeted everyone he met, quickening his pace toward Tiger Head Mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After mastering entry-level archery, his strength had increased, and he could now draw a Six Power Bow, which significantly improved his physical condition.

Via hunting these dimensional creatures, humans acquire their powers...&rdquo; As the grizzled Yu Qiubai lectured, he would occasionally cast his gaze to the corner seat at the back of the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other students were listening attentively, but the boy in the corner had his textbook in front of him while sleeping with his arm lay outstretched on the table. From time to time, one could hear faint snoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yu Qiubai shook his head indiscernibly as he sighed inwardly.&nbsp;<i>So what if you are talented? What can you accomplish if you falter from a single setback? Although the setback from that failure was big, not recovering from it really doesn&rsquo;t make him live up to the former principal&rsquo;s approbation of him.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yu Qiubai recalled what the former principal had said to him before his retirement. Looking back at the boy sleeping soundly on the table with drool hanging from the corner of his lips, he couldn&rsquo;t help but shake his head and sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Qiubai, I&rsquo;ve seen many geniuses in my life. In summary, there are two types of geniuses.&rdquo; The former principal back then had very bright eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are the two types?&rdquo; Yu Qiubai had asked curiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One type of genius is called Zhou Wen, the other type is the other geniuses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former principal&rsquo;s words left a deep impression on Yu Qiubai, but the student who was given heaps of praises by the former principal was now a degenerate, one who had no intention of improving himself. All he did was sleep in class. After class, he would be gaming on his cellphone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yu Qiubai had attempted to bolster Zhou Wen&rsquo;s confidence in the past, hoping that he could rally him up. But despite the numerous pep talks, Zhou Wen remained the same. He continued sleeping in class and gaming out of class. He didn&rsquo;t focus on cultivation as though he had lost all sense of enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Ring!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the bell ringing to mark the end of class, Yu Qiubai saw Zhou Wen sit straight up, having awoken from his sweet slumber. Without even turning back, he grabbed his phone and rushed out of the classroom. This only disappointed Yu Qiubai as he muttered with a sigh, &ldquo;Principal, I&rsquo;ve tried my best. Unfortunately, Zhou Wen is a hopeless case.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen jogged the entire way and soon left the building before coming to a secluded corner in the school compound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t oblivious to the strange looks his teachers and schoolmates gave him, but he didn&rsquo;t take it to heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others believed that Zhou Wen had wallowed in self-misery because he had failed to handle the setback, but he knew very well that he had never taken the defeat to heart. The reason he was &ldquo;abandoning himself to vice&rdquo; was due to an incomprehensible reason that even he couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After unlocking his phone, with great familiarity, Zhou Wen launched a game program called &ldquo;Ant Nest&rdquo;. Soon, the phone&rsquo;s screen revealed the dark interior of an ant nest. The meandering paths had countless black ants crawling about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After ensuring that no one was looking at him, Zhou Wen pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strange scene happened the next second. The drop of blood seeped into the screen as a blood-colored avatar appeared in the game screen of Ant Nest. Beside the blood-colored avatar was a stat window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age: 16 years</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength: 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speed: 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constitution: 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy: 4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic Meditation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy Skills: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companion Beast: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since the dimensional storms, all sorts of dimensional life forms had appeared. They were roughly categorized as Mortal, Legendary, Epic, and Mythical. Humans stood at the bottom of the totem pole as Mortals. By cultivating in Primordial Energy Arts, they could raise their constitutions and evolve to higher life forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, simply cultivating in a Primordial Energy Art to hone one&rsquo;s body and evolve was extremely slow. Hunting dimensional creatures and robbing them of their dimensional crystals for one&rsquo;s own use allowed accelerated evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pan-dimensional creatures lurked in dangerous places. Other than the zones where humanity had explored, the other zones were almost a sure ticket to death. Not everyone was willing to risk their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Earth&rsquo;s federation had clear rules&mdash;underaged youths were forbidden entry into the dimensional zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ascetic Meditation, which Zhou Wen had cultivated, was also a Primordial Energy Art. It solely relied on arduously tempering one&rsquo;s body to cultivate Primordial Energy without the reliance on external forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the federation, there were plenty of sixteen-year-old geniuses who could produce Primordial Energy from cultivation, but few people on Earth could do it simply by cultivating Ascetic Meditation and tempering his body to produce Primordial Energy, especially without any external help. He was the only one capable of doing so in the history of the small town of Guide City&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after, every teacher and student in Guide High School believed that Zhou Wen would achieve great things in the future. Then, one day a transfer student came to Guide High School and challenged him. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the transfer student defeated him in one strike. Furthermore, it was done by a girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen stopped cultivating arduously after that. He appeared to abandon himself to vice. People imagined that he was mentally weak and couldn&rsquo;t suffer the setback, but Zhou Wen knew very well that his change had nothing to do with the failure. It was completely because of the mysterious phone in his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen looked down at his phone as he kept controlling the blood-colored avatar on it to slay the black ants in an Ant Nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant... Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant... Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant...&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notifications quickly flashed past as he killed every ant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Ding!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After killing countless Vigor Ants, he suddenly heard a crisp sound as a special notice appeared on the screen: Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen focused his gaze and saw a crystalline body resembling a diamond that appeared after a Vigor Ant was killed. On it was the number five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was delighted as he hurriedly controlled the blood-colored avatar to pick up the Primordial Energy Crystal. The moment the Primordial Energy Crystal touched its fingers, it immediately transformed into a strange aura that drilled into the blood-colored avatar&rsquo;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, Zhou Wen felt strength surge into his body from his phone as though he had been struck by lightning. It caused the Primordial Energy within him to be rapidly replenished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Primordial Energy entry in the blood-colored avatar&rsquo;s stats went from four to five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After killing a dimensional creature, there was a chance that various kinds of crystals would drop. The most common crystals were Strength, Speed, Constitution, and Primordial Energy Crystals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The usage of Strength Crystals enhanced the Strength of humans, while using Speed Crystals increased one&rsquo;s speed. The other crystals had similar effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in reality, crystals didn&rsquo;t have numeric displays. Humans couldn&rsquo;t see their own stats and only knew that their Strength increased after using a Strength Crystal without knowing the exact quantitative increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mysterious phone in Zhou Wen&rsquo;s hand not only allowed him to obtain dimensional crystals that others had to risk their lives in dimensional zones to obtain, but it also allowed him to see the numeric values of the dimensional creatures, himself, as well as the dimensional crystals.</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:27:31', '2025-04-16 05:27:31');

(79, 26, 'Chapter 2: Ant Nest', 'chapter-2-ant-nest', '<p>Ever since he had obtained that phone, Zhou Wen had spent nearly every moment grinding on it with a game. In turn, he received all kinds of dimensional crystals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, his Strength was 7, Speed was 4, Constitution was 7, and Primordial Energy was 1. After receiving the dimensional crystals from grinding, he had raised all these values in slightly more than a month. If it were in the past, it might have taken him years to develop so quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After using large numbers of dimensional crystals, Zhou Wen realized a set of rules. No matter which dimensional crystal it was, as long as its value was higher than his, using it would result in his stats directly rising to the same value as the said dimensional crystal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the dimensional crystal&rsquo;s value was lower or the same as his, it could only replenish some of his energy. Then, by cultivating the Primordial Energy Art, he could raise his own stats instead of a direct raise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This also meant that the higher the dimensional crystal&rsquo;s value was, the better. Its effects on Zhou Wen would also be amplified. However, having killed so many Vigor Ants in the Ant Nest, the highest Strength Crystal he had seen was a 9. The highest Constitution Crystal was only an 8. Speed Crystals were all low in value. Primordial Energy Crystals were extremely rare. The 5 he had received today were the highest valued he had seen to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen had considered the possibility that it had something to do with the Vigor Ants&rsquo; natural makeup. They were outstanding when it came to their Strength and Constitution, but their Speed was lacking. This was also why the Strength Crystals that he received were relatively high in value, while Speed Crystals weren&rsquo;t much to speak of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even low-valued dimensional crystals could be used as energy supplements, allowing Zhou Wen to quickly cultivate Ascetic Meditation; thus, it wasn&rsquo;t completely useless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only regret was that the crystals that dropped in the game were directly absorbed upon contact with the blood-colored avatar. They couldn&rsquo;t be brought to the real world; otherwise, just the sale of the low-valued crystals he had no use for would be enough to make him quite a wealthy person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were many ants in the Ant Nest, and whenever they discovered Zhou Wen&rsquo;s blood-colored avatar, the number that gathered only increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After killing over a hundred Vigor Ants, another dimensional crystal dropped. Unfortunately, it was a Strength Crystal 3 and could only be used for energy replenishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drop rate of dimensional crystals wasn&rsquo;t high, and most of them were valued at 3 or lower. The higher-valued ones had extremely low drop rates, so Zhou Wen could only rely on massive amounts of grinding to raise the chances of him getting them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was also the reason he often slept in class and stopped cultivating&mdash;apart from classes, he spent the rest of his time grinding, even at night. He didn&rsquo;t have the time or energy to cultivate or pay attention in class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, the rate at which he strengthened himself was incomparable to the past. If he had only cultivated Ascetic Meditation like before, the time it took to raise his Primordial Energy to 5 would have been several times or even dozens of times longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the number of Vigor Ants increased, Zhou Wen was beginning to feel overwhelmed. Before long, the blood-colored avatar was inundated by Vigor Ants, and the screen went black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen had no choice but to restart the game by dripping a drop of blood onto the game&rsquo;s screen. His blood was akin to a 1-Up in games&mdash;one drop of blood was a life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the game launched, he embarked on his grinding again, killing one Vigor Ant after another. However, Zhou Wen wasn&rsquo;t too lucky this time. Not a single dimensional crystal dropped despite killing over a hundred Vigor Ants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Zhou Wen was a sedate person and not quick-tempered, he continued to patiently grind in the Ant Nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, he saw a somewhat special Vigor Ant amidst the hordes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Vigor Ant was blood-red in color as though it was completely covered in blood. It stood out among the other black Vigor Ants, and its head was slightly bigger. Zhou Wen noticed it immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon noticing the red Vigor Ant gearing for a charge, Zhou Wen cautiously probed it and found its Strength and Speed was far greater than other black Vigor Ants. However, it was still manageable for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After positioning the blood-colored avatar several times, it managed to hit the red Vigor Ant, but only dealt minor damage to it. He had failed to slay it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there was still clear progress&mdash;the red Vigor Ant&rsquo;s health bar was slowly dropping. Perhaps about a hundred strikes were needed to slay it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, the red Vigor Ant was only slightly faster than the typical black Vigor Ant. The blood-colored avatar had enough time to position itself and dodge, so killing it was only a matter of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the black Vigor Ants were increasing in number. The development worried Zhou Wen because, at this speed, he might be swarmed by the ant horde before he successfully killed the red Vigor Ant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, no idea came to mind for the time being. Zhou Wen could only do his best to control the blood-colored avatar&rsquo;s speed to deal damage to the red Vigor Ant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as the red Vigor Ant&rsquo;s health bar almost depleted to zero, the surrounding Vigor Ants increased, giving the blood-colored avatar no space to circle around the former.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Crack!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood-colored avatar failed to dodge in time and was bitten by a black Vigor Ant. Instantly, its health bar was almost halved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen knew that he was at the end of the rope. All he could do was to use the blood-colored avatar to deliver one final strike with all its might at the red Vigor Ant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Boom!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the punch landed, the red Vigor Ant&rsquo;s vital spot was struck. Its final bit of health was depleted and its red carapace instantly exploded. Two crystals burst out from its carcass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen didn&rsquo;t have the luxury to see what type of dimensional crystals they were. His blood-colored avatar was in a critical state as the two crystals were picked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moments after the blood-colored avatar picked up the two dimensional crystals, it was swarmed by the Vigor Ant horde, and before long, the screen went black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen looked at the two notifications that appeared on the screen. He heaved a deep sigh of relief for he had had similar experiences. As long as he could pick up a dimensional crystal before dying, the effects would be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Primordial Energy Crystal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Killed Mortal creature, Vigor Ant. Discovered Vigor Ant Crystal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon seeing the two notifications on the screen, Zhou Wen couldn&rsquo;t help but be taken aback. He had seen a Primordial Energy Crystal drop plenty of times, but a dimensional crystal named after Vigor Ants was a first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a brief pause, Zhou Wen reacted. Although he had never seen such dimensional crystals, he had heard of their existence. In textbooks and videos on the Internet, people had used similar crystals. However, they weren&rsquo;t Vigor Ant Crystals, but crystals of other dimensional creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Could it be that this is one of those legendary dimensional crystals?&nbsp;</i>While Zhou Wen was feeling exhilarated, he felt a strange force from his phone spread through his body.</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:27:56', '2025-04-16 05:27:56'),
(80, 26, 'Chapter 3: Vigor Divine Fist', 'chapter-3-vigor-divine-fist', '<p>A force surged through Zhou Wen&rsquo;s body like a bolt of lightning. He was no stranger to such a feeling for it was the feeling he received when absorbing Primordial Energy Crystals. However, this absorption was far more intense than anything he had previously felt. It was many times more intense than his past absorption of the five-valued Primordial Energy Crystal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>What&rsquo;s the value of this Primordial Energy Crystal? Why is it so intense?&nbsp;</i>As Zhou Wen reeled in delight, he felt another force surge into his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the Primordial Energy Crystal, this force surged through his body like an electric snake, opening up his originally sealed meridians, opening up a strange new path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>It&rsquo;s true... The Vigor Ant Crystal is a Primordial Energy Skill Crystal as spoken in legends... However, I wonder what this Vigor Ant&rsquo;s Primordial Energy Skill is...&nbsp;</i>Zhou Wen was filled with anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the electric snake-like force flowed through his body, Zhou Wen&rsquo;s Primordial Energy was being stirred as it began circulating in the newly opened pathways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen was surprised to discover that with the circulation of the Primordial Energy, his hands turned blood-red with a metallic sheen. Furthermore, he had a strange swollen feeling. Although his palms didn&rsquo;t increase in size, it made him feel that his hands contained an immense strength, one that was eager to blast out his palms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Zhou Wen had the urge to deal a punch, but he ultimately held back. He was on campus, and it wasn&rsquo;t in his best interest to cause a commotion. Furthermore, any damage to public property required him to pay compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly twenty minutes later, the swelling feeling gradually subsided. His hands recovered to normal as the Primordial Energy in him stopped circulating. However, Zhou Wen knew that this Primordial Energy blast skill had been imprinted deep in his body and soul. It had seemingly become innate to his body, something he could not forget no matter how he tried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen couldn&rsquo;t wait to look at his phone. The game interface had already gone black. He immediately restarted the game and dripped a drop of blood in. When his in-game avatar appeared, he immediately checked his character stats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age: 16 years</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeform level: Mortal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength: 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speed: 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constitution: 8</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy: 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy Art: Ascetic Meditation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primordial Energy Skill: Vigor Divine Fist (Rank 7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companion Beast: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen was overjoyed. His Primordial Energy had risen all the way to 9. It meant that the Primordial Energy Crystal he had absorbed was valued at 9. And the Rank 7 indicated behind Vigor Divine Fist was similar to seven-valued stat crystals. Without any cultivation, Zhou Wen&rsquo;s Vigor Divine Fist had reached a rather high rank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Primordial Energy Skills were relatively rare, they were rather expensive. However, after receiving this Skill, he would make use of it. He could greatly enhance his various abilities, unleashing combat strength that far exceeded his normal standards. It gave him the important means to protect himself and kill enemies. No one would dislike having too many Primordial Energy Skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, Zhou Wen had lacked the finances to purchase Primordial Energy Skill Crystals and with him fully focused on cultivating Ascetic Meditation, he lacked the time and energy to practice the Skills. This Vigor Divine Fist was his first Primordial Energy Skill, and from its name and effects, it was likely a skill that enhanced the strength of both his fists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Indeed, the Ant Nest in the game is identical to the dimensional zones in the real world. Does this mean that the game will also drop Companion Beasts?&nbsp;</i>Zhou Wen felt slightly pumped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he began grinding again in the game, his avatar was similarly able to use Vigor Divine Fist. Eagerly, Zhou Wen made his avatar use Vigor Divine Fist to see its might.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Boom!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood-colored avatar struck a Vigor Ant, bashing its head into its body. Then, its body exploded due to the immense pressure. Its flesh, blood, and carapace splattered everywhere, reducing it to a blob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen was alarmed and delighted upon seeing this. The blood-colored avatar was equivalent to a clone. If it could produce such might, it also meant that he could do the same in reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, he had needed several strikes to kill a Vigor Ant, and that had needed him to strike a vital spot. Vigor Divine Fist could ignore the Vigor Ant&rsquo;s carapace&rsquo;s defense and directly blast them apart. Its strength was frighteningly potent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, although Vigor Divine Fist was powerful, this punch expended 4 Primordial Energy. With Zhou Wen&rsquo;s maximum Primordial Energy at 9, he could only deliver two strikes before he was drained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Primordial Energy could recover on its own, it happened rather slowly. Zhou Wen took an hour to recover one point, so it was sorely insufficient to keep up with his expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, he could also use Primordial Energy Crystals to quickly recover Primordial Energy. To most people, this was an extremely extravagant act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he had received a Primordial Energy Skill, he could only use it as a trump card for now. Zhou Wen continued patiently grinding as before, hoping that a more magical drop would appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grinding was undoubtedly dull and boring. However, for a person who could hone his body and cultivate Primordial Energy through Ascetic Meditation before the age of sixteen, this boredom was nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Zhou Wen was holding his phone and engrossed with grinding, he suddenly sensed someone approaching him. Looking up, he saw a tall girl in a high-school uniform walk over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen turned to look around her. Students typically didn&rsquo;t come here, and it was the same at present. He was apparently the only person around for dozens of meters, and it was for this reason that he chose this spot to game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Don&rsquo;t tell me Fang Ruoxi is looking for me?&nbsp;</i>Zhou Wen looked at the girl walking straight towards him, and in response, he could only put away his phone for he didn&rsquo;t wish for anyone to see what was on it. Otherwise, it could invite huge trouble for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi was tall, standing at a height of 1.75 meters. At this age, she wasn&rsquo;t short among men and would stand out among women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although she was tall, her body proportions were excellent. Together with her slender body and constant training, she didn&rsquo;t seem too big in size. Her long, slender legs and exaggerated curves gave quite a strong visual impact. She had a primal charm of a feral nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi&rsquo;s name was quite a demure name for a girl, but it didn&rsquo;t match her character. She was a rather proud girl. Before An Jing transferred over, Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen were considered the two most illustrious geniuses in Guide High School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the two of them weren&rsquo;t in the same class. They both had asocial characters, and as Zhou Wen spent most of his time focusing on cultivating Ascetic Meditation and honing his body, the two never had much interaction other than the polite greeting from time to time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi was clearly here for Zhou Wen. It left him perplexed, unsure why she was looking for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Zhou Wen, I wish to invite you to join my team for the combat test at the end of the graduation exams.&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi came before Zhou Wen and said those startling words to him.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:28:19', '2025-04-16 05:28:19'),
(81, 26, 'Chapter 4: Fang Ruoxi’s Invitation', 'chapter-4-fang-ruoxis-invitation', '<p>The cultivation of Primordial Energy Art already played an important role in the Earth Federation&rsquo;s physical education system. Apart from the ordinary subjects tested at the college entrance examinations, there was a special combat test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As combat tests were dangerous, not every candidate needed to participate, and the results weren&rsquo;t included in the overall score of the entrance examinations. It was completely voluntary to participate, but to apply for some special schools, the results of a combat test was necessary for standardization purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past ten years, more and more famous schools used the results of the combat test as one of the standards for student recruitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, to get a job involving dimensional zones, the results on the combat test was a very good prerequisite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Zhou Wen could obtain dimensional crystals from the phone without him risking his life to enter dimensional zones, he still planned on taking the combat test and enter a school focused on cultivation. This would aid him in getting a job related to the dimensional zones in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Zhou Wen didn&rsquo;t involve himself in any dimensional zone work, he wouldn&rsquo;t have the sources or channels to obtain dimensional crystals. This would make it difficult for him to explain his rapid growth or any Companion Beasts he might receive in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By hiding in plain sight he would not garner the notice of others, just as a diamond would be lost in a sea of crystals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen didn&rsquo;t wish to risk his life at the dimensional zones, but he needed to have a job involving such matters. At the very least, he needed a channel to obtain dimensional items. This way, he wouldn&rsquo;t be suspected when he used large numbers of dimensional crystals in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combat test wasn&rsquo;t a solo affair. Instead, it was carried out in a team of four. Apart from one&rsquo;s individual combat prowess, teamwork, leadership, and other traits influenced the final results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one were to be the final man standing in the combat test, with the other teammates dropping out ahead of time or an accident happening, one&rsquo;s score would be greatly affected, even if the individual did very well to receive high individual scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen had quite a good reputation in Guide High School in the past. He was an ideal teammate, but in the past month or so, his image and reputation had drastically declined. There were also significant doubts about his abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was still understandable if an ordinary student were to team up with him, but for Fang Ruoxi who had a chance of coming first in the Guide City combat test, there wasn&rsquo;t a good reason for her to recruit him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen had been famous because of his cultivation of Ascetic Meditation. But when it came to actual strength, there were a few sixteen-year-olds in Guide High School who had cultivated Primordial Energy. However, they were not like Zhou Wen who simply relied on honing his body to cultivate Primordial Energy. They had more or less absorbed Primordial Energy Crystals to supplement their cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why are you recruiting me?&rdquo; Zhou Wen asked Fang Ruoxi with piqued interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi and Zhou Wen locked gazes. Her eyes were clear and untainted like a mountain spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I want to do my best to get a high score on the combat test, so I need a strong teammate. And you have that strength,&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi said calmly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You are referring to me from a month ago, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi&rsquo;s glimmering eyes stared at Zhou Wen intently as she said firmly, &ldquo;From what I see, Zhou Wen is Zhou Wen. He has never changed. You are still the only person in Guide High School that I view as my match.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen was slightly taken aback. He was rather surprised that Fang Ruoxi thought so highly of him. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel some indescribable, odd feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s An Jing if you say something like that?&rdquo; Zhou Wen said in a self-deprecating manner. Although he wasn&rsquo;t concerned about his defeat under An Jing&rsquo;s hands, he had to admit that she was much stronger than he was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi sighed. &ldquo;I said the only person in Guide High School. An Jing was never one of us. Also, she will not be participating in the college entrance exams here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Zhou Wen was taken aback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? She has already transferred out.&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi paused and continued, &ldquo;Although I don&rsquo;t know An Jing&rsquo;s origins, I&rsquo;m certain that she has exceeded the Mortal stage. To reach such a stage at her age, she must have quite a remarkable background. And with that strength of hers, it was completely unnecessary to challenge you. Furthermore, her arrival and departure happened so suddenly. It gives the feeling that she just came here to beat you up. I even imagined that you were acquainted with her and had crossed her somehow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen had never thought too much about it previously. Now, on careful thought, it did seem to be the case. He could, however, be sure that he had never met An Jing before, much less have crossed her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How is that possible? I&rsquo;ve never met her before. How could I have crossed her?&rdquo; Zhou Wen tried carefully recalling, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out how he could have had bad blood with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was just overthinking it.&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi didn&rsquo;t continue on the topic as she looked at Zhou Wen and asked, &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your answer?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since you are willing to team up with me, I naturally don&rsquo;t mind cozying up to someone powerful,&rdquo; Zhou Wen said with a shrug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a deal. I&rsquo;ve already found the other two teammates. Starting today, the four of us will train together during cultivation classes in the afternoon. We need to ensure that we have the necessary teamwork and coordination during the combat test.&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi looked at her wristwatch and turned to say to Zhou Wen, &ldquo;Come on. Cultivation classes are about to begin.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Li Zhi and Tian Xiangdong watched Fang Ruoxi return with Zhou Wen, they were quite surprised. They knew that she had gone to find their fourth teammate, but weren&rsquo;t aware of who she had in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, upon realizing that it was Zhou Wen, they felt puzzled. They all knew of Zhou Wen&rsquo;s antics over the past month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultivation was in an ever-regressive state, especially combat. Even frequent practice made it difficult to seize fleeting opportunities in battle. The lack of practice for a few days greatly slowed down one&rsquo;s reflexes. Considering how Zhou Wen hadn&rsquo;t practiced for over a month with him completely engrossed in gaming, to the point of looking pale and sickly, it was almost a certainty that his combat abilities had drastically fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was just like a professional boxer. They needed enough time to recover and train after a period of zero practice to compete in matches again. No one could become stronger doing nothing. They only became weaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They weren&rsquo;t that far off from the college entrance exams, and even if Zhou Wen made a comeback like a prodigal son, it would be very difficult for him to recover his original combat prowess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ruoxi, don&rsquo;t tell me the fourth teammate is Zhou Wen? Is this a joke!?&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong rubbed his nose and said in an exaggerated manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking. Zhou Wen will be our fourth teammate,&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi said in all seriousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong looked at Fang Ruoxi and then at Zhou Wen. He habitually rubbed his nose and said, &ldquo;Ruoxi, all of us know how talented and capable Zhou Wen is, but he hasn&rsquo;t been training for more than a month. Even if he were to restart his training now, it will be difficult for him to recover his former standards. Our goal is to be first in Guide City&rsquo;s combat test. I don&rsquo;t think Zhou Wen is the best candidate? Why don&rsquo;t we do this? I have some ties with Zheng Yi. If you feel uncomfortable asking him, I&rsquo;ll do the invitation. How about that?&rdquo;</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:28:48', '2025-04-16 05:28:48'),
(82, 26, 'Chapter 5 - Strength Test', 'chapter-5-strength-test', '<p>Tian Xiangdong&rsquo;s words were clearly directed at Zhou Wen, but the latter wasn&rsquo;t angered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combat test at the college entrance exam was key to the latter half of an average person&rsquo;s life. Anyone would hope to do their best and not have others affect their own results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether one could attend a reputable school, find a decent job after graduation, or even have the chance of entering high society, was highly tied to the test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the strength of a teammate affected one&rsquo;s safety. No one wished to use their lives as a joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Zhou Wen had aimed for a reputable school before he obtained the mysterious phone. This gave him more opportunities to become stronger and not let his talent go to waste. Therefore, Zhou Wen could fully comprehend Tian Xiangdong&rsquo;s rationale for saying such things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Tian Xiangdong said his piece, he stopped looking at Fang Ruoxi and stared at Zhou Wen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi looked at Zhou Wen and said, &ldquo;Zheng Yi might be outstanding as well, but I think Zhou Wen is the best candidate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the side, Li Zhi thought and said, &ldquo;We know you have an eye for talent, Ruoxi. Zhou Wen is indeed outstanding, but the combat test results are very important to all of us. We have to treat it with utmost seriousness. Let&rsquo;s do this. If Zhou Wen doesn&rsquo;t mind, we can do a simple test. Once the results of the test are out, it will be obvious if Zhou Wen suits our team.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Li Zhi&rsquo;s right. I agree,&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong said immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What kind of test?&rdquo; Fang Ruoxi asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be simple? I&rsquo;m the weakest among the three of us. Let Zhou Wen fight me in combat. As long as he defeats me, he will naturally be qualified to join our team. You wouldn&rsquo;t call that bullying, right?&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong hurriedly said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi didn&rsquo;t say a word and looked at Zhou Wen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen knew that he needed to voice his opinion at such times; otherwise, it would be difficult for him to join the team. Although he wasn&rsquo;t too interested in joining this team, he still wished to get good results for the combat test. Fang Ruoxi&rsquo;s team was likely considered the strongest team at Guide High School, so there was definitely no harm in joining them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with that. However, actual combat has risks. It would be terrible if anyone gets injured,&rdquo; Zhou Wen said with a nod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong laughed in response. &ldquo;Zhou Wen, I know you&rsquo;ve been cultivating Ascetic Meditation. Your Constitution and Strength must be extraordinary, but your Speed must be lacking. I won&rsquo;t take advantage of your weaknesses. Why don&rsquo;t we determine the winner through a Strength competition?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi couldn&rsquo;t help but frown when she heard Tian Xiangdong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong cultivated Lightning Art and it was also a Primordial Energy Art that primarily unleashed massive bursts of strength. Tian Xiangdong had also coupled Lightning Art with a Primordial Energy Skill, Lighting Fist. Tian Xiangdong&rsquo;s Lightning Fist had only reached Rank 1, however, among typical high school students, the chances of them coming into contact with a Primordial Energy Skill was rather low. To grasp one Primordial Energy Skill, especially one that matched their Primordial Energy Art, was very rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi didn&rsquo;t know Zhou Wen&rsquo;s family background, but from the way he cultivated a Primordial Energy Art like Ascetic Meditation, without ever purchasing any supplementary Primordial Energy Crystals, it was highly likely that his family wasn&rsquo;t well-to-do. If he couldn&rsquo;t even afford Primordial Energy Crystals, how could he have the money to buy the expensive Primordial Energy Skill Crystals?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, in his battle with An Jing, he hadn&rsquo;t used any Primordial Energy Skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fang Ruoxi&rsquo;s lips quivered, but she didn&rsquo;t say a word. She thought inwardly, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how Zhou Wen will handle this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen looked at Tian Xiangdong and asked, &ldquo;How do we compete in Strength?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Although the school has a Strength-measuring device, those lifeless numbers don&rsquo;t mean much. Let&rsquo;s exchange blows. Whoever retreats loses. How about that?&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong said with squinted eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better we use the school&rsquo;s Strength-measure device,&rdquo; Zhou Wen said after some thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why? Are you afraid of me injuring you?&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong said, curling his lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhou Wen smiled without a word. He was more afraid of killing Tian Xiangdong with one punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong&rsquo;s Primordial Energy Skill, Lightning Fist, wasn&rsquo;t a secret at school. Just relying on strength alone probably couldn&rsquo;t beat him. Therefore, if Zhou Wen used Vigor Divine Fist, he was afraid that a single punch would obliterate Tian Xiangdong&rsquo;s arm as well as his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Alright. Since you&rsquo;re afraid, let&rsquo;s use the Strength-measuring device,&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong said, feeling some regret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past three years in high school, all the teachers and students had claimed that Zhou Wen was the number one genius of Guide High School. Tian Xiangdong naturally wasn&rsquo;t very accepting of this accolade and had long wished to prove himself by defeating Zhou Wen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a tiny wish many top students at the school had. After Zhou Wen was defeated by An Jing&rsquo;s single blow, this desire subsided significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since there was a chance to defeat him, Tian Xiangdong still held some anticipation and excitement. After all, Zhou Wen was once honored as Guide High School&rsquo;s number one genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing that left Tian Xiangdong regretful was that he couldn&rsquo;t personally defeat Zhou Wen as An Jing did. All he could do was defeat him with numbers on a Strength-measuring device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that it was lunchtime, the device room didn&rsquo;t have any students. As always, Yu Qiubai was inspecting the various devices personally, checking to see if there were any problematic ones that could receive timely repairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Yu Qiubai sat inside a spacecraft-like Primordial Energy-measurement device, he heard someone push open the door. Following that there were footsteps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>It&rsquo;s lunchtime. Who would come here?&nbsp;</i>Yu Qiubai looked out the observation hole from inside the device and discovered that it was Fang Ruoxi, Tian Xiangdong, Li Zhi, and Zhou Wen. He couldn&rsquo;t help but be somewhat surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These four students could basically be considered the top elites of Guide High School&rsquo;s graduating class. Apart from Zhou Wen&rsquo;s wallowing in self-misery, the other three were highly anticipated to do well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the four to come to the device room, including Zhou Wen, left Yu Qiubai curious. He had no idea what they were doing here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Four... Could these four be forming a team to participate in the combat test... But with Zhou Wen&rsquo;s current state... How could Fang Ruoxi and the rest be willing to form a team with him?&nbsp;</i>Yu Qiubai&rsquo;s heart stirred as he remained inside the Primordial Energy-measuring device. He was curious as to what they were up to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going first? You or me?&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong walked to the Strength-measuring device and turned to look at Zhou Wen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Anything works,&rdquo; Zhou Wen said indifferently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Anyway, everyone gets three tries. The highest one shall count. Since it doesn&rsquo;t matter who goes first, I&rsquo;ll do the honors first,&rdquo; Tian Xiangdong said as he walked in front of the device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong took a deep breath as he circulated his Lightning Art and gathered his strength before smashing his fist into the pressure board on the Strength-measuring device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure board was made up of a metal alloy with hydraulic machinery behind. Based on the different amount of strength delivered, the board would jerk back and produce a figure onscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Tian Xiangdong threw the punch, a series of numbers lit up on the display one after another. It only stopped when it reached 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tian Xiangdong hadn&rsquo;t used Lightning Fist and had only relied on pure Strength. With regard to that, he was rather satisfied with the value of 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the average high-school student, a Strength value of 7 was undoubtedly head and shoulders above their peers.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:29:14', '2025-04-16 05:29:14'),

Living the life according to their routines. You can see such people on the Internet, in offices, in the fields, and on your way to your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even now, I can see them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who are lost in this struggle of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their eyes are somehow dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to me, it feels oddly weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aren&#39;t there a lot of things that we can enjoy in life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like video games, books, music, sports, novels, manga, anime&hellip;..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this age of the internet, how come people look this dead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Or, maybe they are just tired?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, I am not a philosopher or anything. I am not a grand thinker, either. Just a young high-schooler who likes to read web novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, are you listening to me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, a voice woke me up from my thoughts. The same voice I had been hearing for a while now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Shut up. Your voice is ugly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tsk. It must be genetically, then.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bitchy voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was not like that in her youth, but somehow, she became that way at the age of fourteen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her once innocent demeanor had morphed into something more sarcastic and biting over the past couple of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rolled my eyes, not bothering to hide my exasperation. &quot;Seriously, can&#39;t you find something better to do than annoy me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Better than annoying, my dear brother? I doubt it,&quot; she said with a smirk, leaning against me on the bus. Right now, it is already hard to hold my balance, and with her leaning on me, it was even harder to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Should I just let her go down?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pondered for a second but then discarded the idea. After all, imagining what would happen if I were to do so made me immediately drop the idea. It is not like I am some sort of idiot who acts without thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why are you even here? Don&#39;t you have friends or something?&quot; I asked, trying to get back to my phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had already stacked a lot of chapters for the novel I was reading, and it was a good moment to pass the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though reading while standing still can be annoying, at one point, you get used to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about my social life. It&#39;s thriving, unlike someone else&#39;s,&quot; she retorted, emphasizing the &#39;someone&#39; with a mocking tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. Keep telling yourself that,&quot; I muttered, trying to focus on my novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked at me from the side. I could feel her gaze, looking at my phone screen. After spending this much time on public transportation, at some point, you would become someone who was sensitive to such gazes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People somehow love peeping on other people&#39;s private lives, especially elderly people. And, somehow, it is creepy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tsk. Men and their harem fantasies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She clicked her tongue with a blatant criticism. Her words made sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, they would at least make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If she was not an Otome game addict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Coming from a reverse-harem lover like you. It is not like you are that different.&quot; I simply shrugged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People had every right to fantasize about things they liked, and nobody had any right to judge them just for their likes and preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is just my opinion, but those who judge people about the things they like are generally the ones who need to be careful about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently saw some keyboard activists on social media who tried to cancel a show just because a certain character looked underage, stating it was a PDF file situation, even though it was officially stated that was not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, after their whole account was investigated, it was revealed that those were the ones who liked the real PDF file things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, well. That is just an opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that opinion certainly depicts this girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll have you know, reverse-harem books are a lot better executed. At least they have more than one-dimensional characters, unlike those shallow harem stories you read.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People like her.....they always try to justify themselves. That is why I hate the hypocrisy that they show all the time. It is just annoying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And most of the time, their claims are baseless. Once you ask for an example or proof, you can find holes in their argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to do that, I raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh, really? How come? Show me proof.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was about to answer me, but she couldn&#39;t as right at that moment, two people left their seats, and we immediately had to take them without even considering the elderly or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comfort was a rare commodity on a crowded bus, especially if you would be traveling for at least more than an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you stand on your feet all the time, once you reach home&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will feel the real pain, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not on your feet as you might think, but on your back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But well, that is not my problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even now, I could feel the piercing gazes of some old people around us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Hey, old hag. Don&#39;t look at me like that, you know? You are already riding this bus free.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some reason, the government lets old people use public transport for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also have all day as most of them are retired, yet they choose to board the busses when it is time for students to leave their schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, they just deserve to stand on their feet if they can&#39;t even manage their time well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, let&#39;s not ramble too much. It will trigger your ADHD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as we sat down, my dear sister(!) pulled out her phone and opened up a romance fantasy novel. &quot;Here, read this. It&#39;s called Shattered Innocence. You&#39;ll see what I mean.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Wow&hellip;..What a dramatic name&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#39;t help but roll my eyes immediately. Somehow, when books had such names, they tended to become disappointing. That was from my own experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shattered Innocence began with a young noblewoman named Elara, who was an innocent young girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;A classic female lead, huh?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was just your typical female lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A na&iuml;ve, childish, but somehow good-natured noblewoman. Of course, she has a beautiful face adorned with elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A cruel fate awaits you.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the title of the book, it was not that hard to understand what was going to happen either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the prologue was well executed. The writer was pretty skilled in terms of constructing the main character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just one chapter, we would have a grasp of her character and the family dynamics between her and her family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this also included her fianc&eacute;e, the prince of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I continued reading, I could feel my sister&#39;s eyes on me, waiting for my reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s world was turned upside down on the eve of her fifteenth birthday and blessing ceremony. Betrayed by her beloved sister and her unfaithful fianc&eacute;, Elara was stripped of her dignity and cast out. The scene was intense, filled with vivid emotions and heart-wrenching betrayal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;See, I told you it&#39;s good,&quot; my sister chimed in, her voice triumphant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; I mumbled, focused on the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for that was not because the book was good or anything, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many places where it could be executed a lot better, and many plot points felt rushed as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for my focus was simple. Since I had started something, I would need to see the end of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of how stupid a decision is, I am someone who sees the end of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you are right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am stupid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that is who I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, let us return to the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the book, Elara faced numerous challenges. Each character she encountered, whether friend or foe, was richly developed and added layers to the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there was also an academy life; if not for that, how could the writer add the reverse-harem details anyway?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The academy novels have already become clich&eacute;, haven&#39;t they?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But well, at least the academy life was depicted in great detail, showcasing Elara&#39;s growth and the complexity of her relationships with other students, including her sister and former fianc&eacute; who also attended the academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, with it being a romance-fantasy book, there were many supernatural events alongside the history of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And eventually, I reached the end of the published chapters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please wait for the writer to publish more chapters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can send gifts to the writer if you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing as it read like this, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a little bit disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, in just one hour, I finished all fifty chapters that could be read. But well, that is my specialty as well as my curse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She really grows on you, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; my sister said, breaking the silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; I mumbled. &quot;The character development is impressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&hellip;.Don&#39;t lie&hellip;.&quot; She said. &quot;Just tell me your honest feelings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked at her, considering. &quot;Do you really want my opinion?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She nodded her head eagerly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&quot; I decided not to hold back. &quot;Firstly, the writing style is too shallow. Even though the character development is good for some characters, that&#39;s not applicable to all. Many of them have their motives left out, and from the reader&#39;s perspective, this makes them one-dimensional. That&#39;s especially the case for the male characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all seem to be operating solely according to their emotions, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Almost every one of them is a person with a higher standing, and their positions require logical thinking and ruthlessness as traits. But, those traits do seem to completely evaporate when they somehow interact with the protagonist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She listened, her expression turning more thoughtful. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Take the prince, for example,&quot; I continued. &quot;He&#39;s supposed to be this cunning, strategic figure, yet his actions are driven by whims and shallow emotions. It&#39;s inconsistent. And the way the academy life is portrayed, while detailed, falls into too many clich&eacute;s. The supernatural events are interesting, but they feel tacked on rather than integral to the plot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She sighed. &quot;I guess I see your point. But don&#39;t you think you&#39;re being a bit harsh? It&#39;s a romance fantasy, after all. It&#39;s supposed to be a bit... exaggerated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I get that,&quot; I replied. &quot;But exaggeration doesn&#39;t excuse poor character motivations. Especially at the first turning point of the novel. The time when the protagonist, Elara, gets caught by the prince. That part... It was supposed to be the most important part of the novel, yet I don&#39;t get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who in the world cheats on their fianc&eacute;e on their second most important birthday when everyone was attending the banquet?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ah.....That part.....I can see what you are trying to say...It is like shouting I am dumb while you are taking the SAT exam....&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She somehow seemed to agree with me in this part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly!&quot; I continued, getting more animated. &quot;And the scene where Elara was framed&mdash;it&#39;s so contrived. How can people be so stupid as to believe such an event? Can&#39;t they use their brains to speculate more? The whole thing feels forced. It&#39;s like the author just wanted to create drama without thinking it through logically.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My sister suddenly smiled, a knowing look in her eyes. &quot;In this world, people find it way easier to believe what they see rather than think.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I blinked, taken aback by her response. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, her smile looked a bit pained. Just as she leaned back and started to talk, suddenly, my world began to spin as if the very fabric of reality was warping around me. Her voice grew more and more distant with each passing second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An immense headache struck me down, a piercing pain that felt like my skull was being split open. I clutched my head, trying to steady myself, but the sensation was overwhelming. My vision blurred, and the familiar surroundings of the bus faded into an indistinct whirl of colors and shapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After what felt like an eternity, the pain began to subside. I slowly opened my eyes, my vision clearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only to find myself in a peculiar situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>----------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can join the discord if you wish.

I felt like a log, heavy and immobile, unable to control my body. My ears rang, and I felt the gravity shifting, a sense of nausea swirling through me, making it hard to keep it inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard voices, distant and muffled as if they were trying to enter my ears but couldn&#39;t quite make it through. &quot;...Wh&hellip;Miss&hellip;..El&hellip;.a&hellip;..w..t&hellip;...him?...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...Ca&hellip;.th....du&hellip;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The words were fragments, disjointed and incomprehensible. I tried to focus, to understand, but my mind was clouded, refusing to cooperate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, at that exact moment, at the tip of my fingers, I felt a slightly soft touch. It moved, a gentle, reassuring presence in the chaos of my senses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What is this?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that touch, slowly, my vision began to return, though I still couldn&#39;t make sense of anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shapes and colors began to form, and gradually, the world around me took on a semblance of reality. With my vision returning, I was finally able to see the person beneath me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yellow hair was scattered all across the ground, and the eyes were deep blue like the ocean. Yet, those eyes were widened, filled with horror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I struggled to comprehend the scene. The girl beneath me looked terrified, and I realized that I was lying on top of her, pinning her to the ground. My body felt heavy and unresponsive, but I managed to lift myself slightly enough to see the fear etched on her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to speak, but my voice was a raspy whisper. I could feel the nausea intensifying, the disorientation still clouding my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, the girl moved, her mouth opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Get off me!&quot; she cried, her voice trembling with fear. She pushed against me weakly as if she was trying to free herself. But it was not like I was doing anything to her either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her eyes were filled with tears, yet I didn&#39;t know what was happening. With the scream I had just heard right now, my head was an even bigger mess with constant ringing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;RING!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mustered all my strength and rolled to the side, collapsing beside her. My vision swam, but I could see her more clearly now. She had yellow hair and deep blue eyes, features that seemed oddly familiar yet out of place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet her bare skin was laid right before me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://novelbin.com/b/shattered-innocence-transmigrated-into-a-novel-as-an-extra/chapter-2-the-place-where-everything-fell-down\" oncontextmenu=\"setRealHref(event)\" onmouseup=\"setRealHref(event)\" real-href=\"https://s.magsrv.com/click.php?d=H4sIAAAAAAAAA1VQQW7cMAz8ii57NURKMuVjgSCXoM2td9mS1wa8smEpmwTg40t7UzTF6MAZcoYCyRKg0awb9DzVupWL.XHBZ3noDJmmXJs1l7e8pFKaYb0dPfMc4hwv5skCWnfBdnvrT.4skjFWlFqFohRFAp88Ekk9hNs2H_qRzKwZyFpqCUzHeb2npZ_zsYMBXEO.AdMAkDBD2Had5698dgB8mBnZyt8FDAc61B.gvVDjwJOXXBx9b2IcPeIAIIx6Y0aje99a6IZRbPr_5Y9A9VdToqlelSnUmvYU1ZzzOqQ8JFX3kMttvu6hnnpdVXj4VCgqZJU.ZEQNU9jEqlDVKaltCWJ9nyRLpXvaP.s056sa07KouL5nxeeXDoDz2pE_q7bVXm521Jq_.ueMwNqzdGyOS6CcBc.OEP796.e36X_AbwkPVppbuJb9fh7BipXv0PHrC49eQ7Au9V2IMRClCNE6cDga8imlP_7lX35EAgAA&amp;cb=e2e_67ff08a383a1f1.42235247\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nhận ngay 18 Triệu VND dễ d&agrave;ng</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Bare?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if my pondering had triggered them, at that moment, my senses picked up a feeling. The feeling of cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;SHIVER!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I shivered as if I was out cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It is cold?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My body was freezing, as if the cold wind breeze had gone past it. Such a thing did not make any sense. After all, there was no reason for me to be in the cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, I realized something was wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sense of cold, as well as this sense of freezing. And the feeling of capturing everything in the air with my bare skin.....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That implied one thing. The fact that there were no clothes on my body at that moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, I picked up another feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A feeling of something lying over something soft instead of something rigid. It was pretty comfortable, even better than the beds I had ever been on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Beds?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This thought was followed by another realization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was not lying on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was on a bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;YOU! WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, a loud voice woke me up from my thoughts. From the loudness of the voice, my body flinched without being able to make any sense of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl beside me also flinched, her body trembling. I turned my head toward the source of the voice and saw two people standing in the doorway. A young man and a woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man had a regal bearing, his expression a mixture of rage and shock. The woman beside him had a cold, calculating look in her eyes, a smirk playing on her lips. Yet that expression instantly turned to something of confusion and pain, with her eyes widening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that face, it was so familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A familiar face that I felt like I had seen a lot of times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Who...?&quot; I managed to croak out, my confusion growing by the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man&#39;s eyes blazed with fury as he pointed at me. &quot;How dare you! You think you can disgrace me and my family like this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pubfuture.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Ads by Pubfuture\" src=\"https://s3.pubfuture.com/favicon.ico\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://e326060b.epicplay.in/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media.pubfuture.com/2024/10/31/970x2501730350603.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stared at him, my mind struggling to piece together what was happening. The girl beside me, still sobbing, looked up at him with a mixture of fear and desperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I... I don&#39;t understand,&quot; I stammered, my voice barely audible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You dare feign ignorance?&quot; the man snarled. &quot;You have the audacity to lay your hands on my fianc&eacute;e, Elara? While being the fianc&eacute;e of his own sister?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Elara?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name hit me like a bolt of lightning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I seem to be able to recall the name as if it was close to me. As if I heard this name before, as if I was aware of it. Yet, at this exact moment, I wasn&#39;t able to understand any of those at all. My hand was spinning too much, and I couldn&#39;t make any sense of any of those.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man&#39;s focus shifted to the girl beside me. &quot;How could you do this to me, Elara? Why have you done this to me? Why?&quot; His voice broke, tears welling up in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara, still trembling, looked up at him. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening or how I ended up here. This isn&#39;t what it looks like. You have to believe me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man&#39;s face hardened. &quot;How can I believe you when everything is open like this? How can I trust you now?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman beside him stepped forward, her expression one of feigned sadness. &quot;Sister, how could you do this to me with my own fianc&eacute;?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl named Elara&#39;s eyes widened with horror. &quot;Isolde, I didn&#39;t! I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot; She pleaded desperately, her voice cracking. &quot;Please, you have to believe me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that standing girl who was somehow familiar to me, Isolde, shook her head slowly, her lips curving into a mocking smile. &quot;I wish I could, Elara. But the evidence is right here. How could you betray me like this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s pleas grew more frantic. &quot;This is a setup! I don&#39;t know how I got here. Please, you have to believe me!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the man shook his head, stepping back. &quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t believe you anymore.&quot; His voice was filled with a mixture of heartbreak and fury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lay there, my mind reeling, unable to grasp the full extent of the situation. The room seemed to spin around me, and the words exchanged felt surreal, like something out of a nightmare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What is this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, another voice echoed. A voice that wasn&#39;t as callow as others. A voice that was deep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that a sense of dread washed over me, more intense than anything I had ever felt before. It was as if death itself had come for me. The feeling was surreal, paralyzing. I tried to hold back the sense of nausea rising inside my stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that feeling was not unfamiliar. It was as if I had felt such feelings before as if this external pressure applied upon me was not a rare occurrence to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deep voice spoke again, commanding and powerful. &quot;What is happening here?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tall, imposing figure entered the room. His presence was overwhelming, radiating authority. The man looked to be in his late forties, with stern features and eyes that could pierce through steel. He carried himself with the weight of responsibility and power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The room fell silent as everyone turned to face the newcomer. The man&#39;s eyes widened as he took in the scene before him. It was clear he was not expecting to witness such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is the Duke,&quot; someone whispered, the words barely audible over the tension in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Duke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course. That type of title looked befitting of him, I subconsciously thought. Yet, to me, he was just another figure in this bizarre, incomprehensible scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or was he?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I felt like I also knew him. It seemed like even if my memory was hazy, the unconsciousness still recognized him from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He surveyed the scene, his expression hardening. &quot;Explain yourselves,&quot; he demanded, his voice low and dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prince spoke first</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;The prince?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did I know he was the prince? I could not answer that at all. It didn&#39;t matter either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prince&#39;s voice trembled slightly. &quot;Duke, I found your daughter Elara in bed with him&hellip;... She has betrayed me and our family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara, still crying, shook her head vigorously. &quot;Father, please, you have to believe me. I don&#39;t know how this happened. I swear I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Duke&#39;s gaze shifted to Isolde, who looked back at him with wide, innocent eyes. &quot;Sister, how could you do this to me with my own fianc&eacute;?&quot; she repeated, her voice laced with sorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, there was something unsettling about that voice that I couldn&#39;t put my fingers down. That feeling was so tense that I felt like my nausea rose once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Duke&#39;s eyes narrowed as he looked at me. The fierceness in his eyes was so intense that, at that moment, I felt something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two eyes immediately covered my whole very being, and I felt like snakes crawling upon me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kurghk-!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It got hard to breathe, let alone think. However, that feeling disappeared in a split second. Yet, even then, I could no longer hold it in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sense of nausea just spilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Orghk-!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;SPILL!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disgusting liquid spilled to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Disgusting...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What a disgrace&hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could hear some people talking. They were not even keeping their voices to themselves at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Guards,&quot; he said, his voice steady and cold. &quot;Take both of them away.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara protested, her voice filled with desperation. &quot;Father, please! I didn&#39;t do anything! This is all a mistake!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no one believed her. The guards moved forward, grabbing both of us. As they dragged me away, one of them hit me hard on the head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pain exploded in my skull, and everything went black.</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:32:44', '2025-04-16 05:32:44'),
(85, 27, 'Chapter 3: Revelation', 'chapter-3-revelation', '<p>In the darkness, suddenly, the world colored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found myself in a warm room, a room that looked familiar, as if I had just seen one. The air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers, and a soft breeze rustled the curtains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was lying down, my head resting on the lap of a young girl. Her gentle touch soothed my aching head, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. She caressed my hair, her fingers moving with a tenderness that made the pain fade away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lucavion,&quot; she whispered, her voice soft and sweet. &quot;You love me, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to respond, but my voice felt distant as if it belonged to someone else. &quot;Yeah, I love you, Isolde.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She smiled a radiant smile that seemed to light up the entire room. &quot;You believe in me, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, Isolde,&quot; I heard myself say, the words feeling both familiar and strange. &quot;I believe in you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her eyes sparkled with a mixture of affection and something else, something I couldn&#39;t quite place. &quot;Good,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Because you and I are meant to be together, always.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, a nauseating feeling rose from my chest, a feeling that I suppressed for some reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, my Lucavion. Will you drink this for me?&quot; She brought something from her side. For some reason, the nauseating feeling rose more and more, yet as if I was apprehended by something, I hadn&#39;t moved my body at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will do anything for you.&quot; Saying that I gulped it down. At that instant, the feeling of the same nausea rose from my chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the world went dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scene shifted, the warmth of the sunlit room replaced by a cold, oppressive darkness. The girl&#39;s face began to blur, her features becoming indistinct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Isolde?&quot; I called out, my voice echoing in the void.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there was no response, only the lingering sensation of her touch and the faint sound of her laughter fading into the distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I woke up with a start, the dream still fresh in my mind. The darkness of the cell pressed in around me, and the cold stone floor beneath me felt harsh and unforgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lucavion,&quot; I whispered to myself, trying to make sense of the name and the dream. &quot;Isolde...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were oddly familiar yet at the same time unfamiliar. As if I knew them, yet I didn&#39;t at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was such an odd feeling. I felt trapped, unable to comprehend anything that was happening around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything that had happened was like a wave crashing down over which I had no control. I didn&#39;t know what happened or what it meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that second, I started hearing the voice of a young girl crying, her sobs echoing through the darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened there. I don&#39;t know why I was there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her cries were filled with despair, each sob tugging at my heart. I turned my head towards the source of the sound, my senses heightened in the dark cell. The pain in her voice was palpable, and it resonated with the confusion and fear that I felt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Elara?&quot; I called out the name. Subconsciously, it was already registered in my head, most likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sobbing paused for a moment, then resumed, even more heart-wrenching than before. &quot;Why won&#39;t anyone believe me? I didn&#39;t do anything. I swear.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;CREAK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, the door opening sound was heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, light entered the dark place we were in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAP! TAP! TAP!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, I could hear the steps echoing. From the position I was in, I wasn&#39;t in a state where I could see the newcomer; from the sounds, it felt like a woman&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Isolde, sister.&quot; Elara&#39;s voice was filled with a mix of relief and fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The steps stopped, and the light from the doorway illuminated a figure. Isolde stood there, her expression cold and calculating, a stark contrast to the sorrowful one she had worn earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Elara,&quot; Isolde said, her voice smooth and devoid of any warmth. &quot;How unfortunate to see you in such a state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Isolde, please,&quot; Elara pleaded, reaching out to her sister. &quot;You have to believe me. I didn&#39;t do anything. I don&#39;t know how I ended up there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s lips curled into a chilling smile. &quot;Oh, dear sister, I believe you. I believe you didn&#39;t know how you ended up there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s eyes widened in confusion and hope. &quot;You do?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Isolde replied, stepping closer. &quot;Because I was the one who arranged everything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&hellip;..&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, everything stopped, as if the world itself stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This...This line&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slowly, memories came to my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything made sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why I felt it familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why was I feeling like these names? That appearance was something that I knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Shattered Innocence.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was now in that book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>********</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because I was the one who arranged everything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What is this?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara asked herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;That can&#39;t be true&hellip;..No&hellip;..That can&#39;t be right&hellip;..That is not right&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She tried to deny everything. How could she not do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, it was the dear sister of hers&hellip;.The one that she had doted on&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could this happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She gasped, her hand falling to her side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What? Why? Why would you do this to me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s smile widened, and she knelt down to be at eye level with her. The face that she had always seen, the face that was undoubtedly pale and sick most of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It now contained a shade of redness and life in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if she had regained her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expression of relief and the expression of reveling in the pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looked strange. Different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because, dear sister, everything you had was meant to be mine. Your fianc&eacute;, your status, your future. You were always the favored one, the cherished one. But now, all of that will be mine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s heart pounded in her chest, a deafening drumbeat of betrayal and disbelief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her mind raced, desperately trying to piece together the fragments of shattered trust. The world around her seemed to tilt, the familiar walls of her home now alien and hostile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She took a step back, her legs trembling, barely able to support her weight. &quot;Isolde, you can&#39;t mean this. We&#39;ve always been there for each other. I would have given you anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s eyes glinted with a mixture of triumph and something darker, something that made Elara&#39;s blood run cold. &quot;But you never did, Elara. You never saw beyond your own perfect little world. While you basked in everyone&#39;s adoration, I was the shadow, the afterthought. No more. This is my time now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s breath hitched, her vision blurring with unshed tears. She had always known Isolde was envious, but she had never imagined it ran this deep this dark. &quot;I loved you, Isolde. I would have shared everything with you. Why this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde stood up, her posture straight and commanding, a stark contrast to the frail girl Elara had always known. &quot;Because sharing was never enough. I needed to take what was rightfully mine. And now I have.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s mind swirled with memories, moments where she had overlooked Isolde&#39;s subtle hints of resentment and dismissed them as mere sibling rivalry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One by one, those things that she had overlooked started coming out of the light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The times when she felt like a gaze was boring through her when she was leaving Isolde&#39;s room. The times when she felt like Isolde&#39;s smile was somehow fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way she looked at her fianc&eacute;e&hellip;..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How blind she had been. &quot;You betrayed me,&quot; she whispered, the weight of those words settling heavily on her chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s expression softened slightly, but there was no regret, only a cold satisfaction. &quot;I did. And it was so easy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara stared at her sister, struggling to comprehend the depth of her betrayal. Isolde&#39;s face, now filled with a twisted form of joy, was unrecognizable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How?&quot; Elara managed to ask, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde sighed, almost as if she were reminiscing a fond memory. &quot;From the very beginning, dear sister, Adrian loved me. Not you. We were in love long before you even entered the picture. But our families, with their ridiculous promises and alliances, decided you were to be his bride. It didn&#39;t matter that he never wanted you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were trapped, both of us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s mind reeled. Adrian had always been distant, but she had assumed it was just his nature. The truth was far more painful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And I was given Lucavion,&quot; Isolde continued, her voice dripping with disdain. &quot;A stupid country bumpkin who had no idea what was happening around him. But he served his purpose. I needed a way to get rid of both you and him, and the solution was simple. Use your stupidity and his naiveness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s breath quickened as the pieces started to fall into place. &quot;You&hellip; you used him. And me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde nodded, her smile never faltering. &quot;Indeed. I played my part perfectly, feigning illness and weakness to keep you close, to make everyone trust me and never suspect me. And when the time was right, we put my plan into motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plan for the heiress of the dukedom to fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could the banquet of your fifteenth birthday, the day when you would be making your debut, not be the best time for such a scandal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adrian was the one to drug you. Remember how he came earlier than the other guest just to see you? And you had a light drink together&hellip;.Did you really think he came just to see you here, as expected from my stupid sister&hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s breath hitched, her eyes widening in horror as Isolde&#39;s words sunk in. She replayed the memory of that fateful evening in her mind. Adrian&#39;s earlier-than-expected arrival, his warm smile, the drink they shared&mdash;a drink she now realized had tasted slightly off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde continued her words, not minding what Elara was thinking at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But aside from that, no, I did not use Lucavion at all. He did everything out of his own volution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the bottom, I knew he always desired you. He always wanted you instead of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when I told him that you wanted to be with him instead of Adrian or I told him Adrian was forcing you into a relationship and that you were too scared to speak out, he instantly took the bait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That disgusting bastard instantly believed me since he wanted to, and out of his own desires, he came to that room thinking you would have chosen a stupid country bumpkin like him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment Elara heard about this, she couldn&#39;t believe her ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;That Lucavion...No&hellip;.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To think that he would do such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An impeccable feeling started rising from her heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A feeling that she couldn&#39;t put her heart to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now here we are&hellip;..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am where I am supposed to be&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you are where you were always supposed to be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara felt a surge of anger mixed with overwhelming sadness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. &quot;You orchestrated everything. Every moment, every detail...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s smile never wavered. &quot;Yes, dear sister. Every moment was meticulously planned. Adrian and I had it all figured out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stopped, looking into Elara&#39;s eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And, sister&hellip;.You had to be there to look in the father&#39;s eyes&hellip;.The moment he realized the pure daughter he thought he raised was actually a whore who would commit such infidelity&hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara&#39;s breath caught in her throat, the cruel words slicing through her like a knife. The image of her father&#39;s devastated expression flashed in her mind, the disbelief and disappointment in his eyes. She had lived that moment and felt the crushing weight of his judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How could you do this to him? To me? To our family?&quot; Elara&#39;s voice shook with a mixture of anger and heartbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isolde&#39;s gaze remained cold, unfeeling. &quot;Because it was what he deserved. Father always saw you as the perfect daughter, the rightful heir. I was nothing but a burden, a sickly shadow in your light. But now, with you disgraced, the path is clear for me to take what should have been mine all along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, sister, that is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From now on, you are nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you will always remain like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever you have, it will all be mine.&quot;</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:33:19', '2025-04-16 05:33:19'),

Which one was real?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer was already revealed before me, though it was hard to accept it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, I just did what I was taught to. Isn&#39;t it right to show care to those who need it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, Isolde.&quot; I sat beside her and gently ran my fingers through her hair, feeling the silkiness between my fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even now, I can remember that same silkiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But was that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were they really mine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Am I Lucavion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or am I...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was I in the first place?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What?

It was as if something was churning there as if my body was trying to throw something out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, the same memory appeared in my head once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was lying down, my head resting on the lap of her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her &#39;gentle&#39; touch soothed my aching head, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. She caressed my hair, her fingers moving with a tenderness that made the pain fade away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lucavion,&quot; she whispered, her voice soft and sweet. &quot;You love me, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to respond, but my voice felt distant as if it belonged to someone else. &quot;Yeah, I love you, Isolde.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The smile was supposed to be radiant, yet now it looked as if it was the fake light of the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You believe in me, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, Isolde,&quot; I heard myself say, the words feeling both familiar and strange. &quot;I believe in you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, that feeling of strangeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could now understand it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was my body that was warning me at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Because you and I are meant to be together, always.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as in the dream, the nauseating feeling rose from my chest once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RUMBLE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My stomach rumbled and churred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, my Lucavion. Will you drink this for me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she showed that thing to my face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That thing that constantly made me want to puke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will do anything for you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Urghk&mdash;!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#39;t hold it back any longer. The nausea overwhelmed me, and I threw up, the disgusting liquid spilling out onto the cold, stone floor of the cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Orghk&mdash;!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It felt like my insides were being wrung out, every drop of bile and acid forcing its way up and out of my body. I heaved again and again until there was nothing left but dry retching and the acrid taste of vomit in my mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My body shook with the effort, and I collapsed back against the wall, gasping for breath. The memories, the pain, the betrayal&mdash;they all swirled together in a nauseating vortex that left me dizzy and weak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I lay there, trying to steady my breath, I noticed something moving in the pool of vomit. My eyes widened in horror as I saw a centipede writhing and squirming its way out of the mess. It was long, segmented, and grotesque, its many legs scuttling over the stone floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wh-what...?&quot; I muttered, my voice shaking. The sight was revolting, and a chill ran down my spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I reached out, trying to grab it, to smash it, to do anything to stop it from moving. But my fingers were too slow, too weak, and the centipede slipped through my grasp, disappearing into the shadows of the cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I could react further, the door creaked open, and the blinding light pierced through the darkness, making me squint and cover my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Get up,&quot; a gruff voice commanded, cutting through the haze of my disorientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to push myself up, my body protesting with every movement. The light was harsh, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw the silhouette of a guard standing in the doorway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What...?&quot; I managed to ask, my voice hoarse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re being moved,&quot; the guard replied curtly, stepping aside to make way for another figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new figure stepped into the cell, and I saw it was a face that didn&#39;t feel unfamiliar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The face was something I had seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;...Who&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer came from the guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sir Alistair came here to take you out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment the name came out of the guard&#39;s mouth, I realized who this was. It was my elder brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alistair Thorne. The heir of the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope ignited in my heart. I opened my mouth to greet him, but before I could speak, suddenly, a fire ignited right before my face, and it burned fiercely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Argh-!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pushed myself back from the flames, my heart pounding with fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, I heard a cold voice saying,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do not ever try to speak, you worm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voice was icy, and as I raised my eyes, I saw Alistair&#39;s gaze fixed on me with intense disdain. His eyes were sharp, unforgiving, and filled with contempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, I realized I was not in a good position at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&hellip;..&quot; I wanted to say something, but the words died in my throat as the flames flickered menacingly closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Silence,&quot; Alistair hissed, his expression darkening. &quot;You&hellip;..After all the things that you have done&hellip;You have no right to speak&hellip;..&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hope that had briefly flickered in my heart was extinguished, replaced by a cold dread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, I decided not to make anything complicated since nothing would matter anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Take him,&quot; I heard Alistair commanding the people behind him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, the sound of metal hitting the ground could be heard. As I looked, I could see the light reflecting from the armor they wore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the insignia right on their chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a familiar one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The insignia of Thorne Viscounty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insignia of my family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were the Thorne family&#39;s knights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knights grabbed me roughly by my arms. Was there a need to do such a thing? After all, it was not like I could escape from here right now, and not like I wanted to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And these guys were supposed to serve us, weren&#39;t they?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can walk by myself,&quot; I protested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of replying with words, another burst of fire ignited near my face, scorching my mouth. The intense heat and pain forced me to recoil, choking back a cry of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked up to see Alistair&#39;s cold eyes locked onto me, and I quickly averted my gaze, understanding that no mercy would come from him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I shut my mouth, realizing that speaking would only bring more pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, it was time to accept it right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From now on, I would not be treated as a normal human being but as a criminal that would need to be punished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until I cleared my name, at least, it was not like it was impossible or anything. If I can drag people on my side, if I can talk to them to at least explain my situation, I think they will believe me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it will be hard, they are my family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right, let&#39;s keep ourselves silent for a while. When the time comes, we can talk. This is not the place to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knights dragged me forward, their grips like iron. Each step was a struggle, my body still weak and trembling from the ordeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, just before we left the place, I made eye contact with the girl in the other cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her clear blue eyes were now filled with redness, most likely because of the tears that she had shed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, as we made eye contact, her eyes took on a different shape. A glint was there. A glint that I had just seen in another person&#39;s eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The glint of hatred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a raw, burning hatred that cut through the haze of my own confusion and pain. Elara&#39;s gaze was piercing, her eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that left no room for misunderstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She hated me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Right&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that it mattered now since I could do nothing to change it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;CREAK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door closed once again as we left the confinement room or whatever it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corridor outside the cell was dimly lit, the walls closing in around me as if to emphasize the hopelessness of my situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emerged into a larger, grander corridor, the light here brighter and more oppressive. I could hear the murmurs of others and feel their eyes on me, judging, condemning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weight of their disdain pressed down on me, and I struggled to keep my head up to maintain some semblance of dignity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knights led me outside, where a carriage awaited. But instead of being placed inside, I was roughly handled and thrown into the luggage compartment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floor was rough, and every bump and jolt of the carriage was magnified by the uncomfortable ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lay there, the rough wood digging into my back, every movement causing more discomfort. The reality of my situation was stark and unforgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was a prisoner, a criminal in the eyes of my family and everyone around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could clear my name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, I needed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that was the only way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there was no mention of Lucavion in the novel, I was free to carve my fate right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or was there a mention?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn&#39;t remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I was tired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It is fine if I sleep a little, right?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there was no one to answer that question anyway, so I just closed my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can check my discord if you want.

I was given food only once a day, and what I received was stone-hard and barely edible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stale bread, tough meat, and the occasional bruised fruit. My stomach growled incessantly, but I forced myself to eat, knowing I needed the strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water was rationed, and I was given only a small amount each day, just enough to keep me from dehydrating. The dryness in my throat was a constant companion, and each sip of water somehow felt like I was relieving myself in the holy water itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The days blurred together in a haze of discomfort and fatigue. The nights were the worst, the cold seeping into my bones as I lay on the hard floor of the carriage. I wanted to coat my body with mana, but since the amount of food I was eating was low, it was hard for my body to recover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I had never been good at using mana efficiently, to begin with. Compared to my elder brother and elder sister, I was a lot worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the darkness, left to my thoughts, even sleep eluded me. Each time I closed my eyes, my stomach would churn with the memory of that centipede and the time Isolde had fed it to me. The grotesque image haunted my mind, making it impossible to find any semblance of peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lay there, counting the ticks of the carriage wheels, each quaking of the rough road jarring me further. The isolation and the darkness pressed in on me, amplifying my fears and doubts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mind wandered to Elara, to the hatred in her eyes and the betrayal that had shattered her life as well as mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;The plot of the novel, Shattered Innocence.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t know how I was here. Was it because I just said something about the novel itself? I remembered talking about the novel on the bus with someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Who?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked myself. There was someone there, yet it was blurry. I couldn&#39;t recall anything at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;How did it come to this?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another question. And the answer was unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Why hadn&#39;t I seen it? The fa&ccedil;ade that she was showing to.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking about Isolde&hellip;.I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of knowing in my heart. All the time that was spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were they nothing but fake?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was that all it amounted to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A stupid country bumpkin who had no idea what was happening around him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered the words that were spoken by the very fianc&eacute;e that I had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;A country bumpkin who had no idea, huh? That seems to be true&hellip;..&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering that I was never aware of such a thing happening, it seems her words were true. It was not like I was an exceptional person either, not that I ever pretended I was one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lucavion, you are going to meet your fianc&eacute;e.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memory flashed vividly in my mind. My father&#39;s stern face loomed over me, his eyes filled with a mixture of hope and sternness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lucavion, you are going to meet your fianc&eacute;e,&quot; he repeated, his voice carrying the weight of duty and expectation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stood before him, feeling the pressure of his gaze. &quot;Yes, Father.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sighed, placing a hand on my shoulder. &quot;Listen to me, son. You must be careful and never annoy the Lady. The Valoria family is a dukedom that our family, the Thorne family, has been a vassal to for generations. It was because of a promise between me and the Duke when we were on the frontlines that the engagement between our two families was made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an opportunity for us to strengthen our position in the noble society. Do you understand?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, Father,&quot; I replied, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. &quot;I will do my best.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start, I couldn&#39;t understand why I was the one who would be the fianc&eacute;e of such a lady. After all, wouldn&#39;t my brother, who was not engaged with anyone at that time, be better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then, after meeting Isolde, I realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was sick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone who could hardly move outside and spent most of her time in her room. Her standing in her family was weak, just like her body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the time, it was her sister, Elara, who got all the attention and the responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And since her standing was low and she wouldn&#39;t be able to influence the noble world too much, sending me instead of my brother would be the right choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also the requirement of having an heir for the family. Since Isolde was always viewed as weak and sick, expecting an heir from her would be hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, even my engagement to her was a way for my family to show that I was not useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, I was not good at controlling mana, nor was I good at the spear that our family specialized in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these thoughts swirled in my mind, the carriage suddenly stopped. The abrupt halt jolted me from my reflections, and I listened intently to the sounds outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAP!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;TAP!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Footsteps approached, heavy and deliberate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doors of the carriage swung open, and daylight flooded in, momentarily blinding me. I squinted, trying to adjust to the sudden brightness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knights stood there, their expressions stern and unreadable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, my trip had ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I climbed out of the carriage with some effort, my body stiff and aching from the rough journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw the familiar sight of the Thorne mansion, the place where I had spent all of my childhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grand structure loomed before me, a mixture of imposing and nostalgic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Move.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knights did not give me any time to reminisce. They grabbed me by the arms and started leading me toward the mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, such an act that was made to a noble would be detrimental and would mostly end with execution since disrespecting a noble meant such punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I can move on my own.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to protest, but I couldn&#39;t. I could feel the eyes that were piercing through me even now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was there, and I knew if I were to just open my mouth, I would be burned. If he was watching this and was now, then the fact that he was keeping it silent meant he was allowing the knights to act like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, I could only shut it and accept the treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The path was lined with well-kept gardens and ornate statues, all of which felt strangely alien despite their familiarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we approached the entrance, the heavy doors of the mansion opened, revealing a man and a woman standing there. The faces were familiar, and I immediately recognized the man from the memory I had just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was my father, Gerald Thorne. His tall and imposing figure was draped in fine, dark clothes, his face stern and weathered from years of duty and responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His sharp eyes were as usual. His demeanor was stern, as usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in his eyes, I could see something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Anger.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it was anger. His eyes contained immense anger that was parallel to elder brother as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His jaw was set tight, and his silver hair was combed back, giving him an air of severe authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside him stood another person, a woman whose presence brought a rush of childhood memories flooding back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Thorne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was a picture of grace and poise, her elegant dress flowing around her as she stood with a regal bearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her hair, a rich chestnut brown, was neatly styled, and her green eyes&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my memories, she had always been gentle, a comforting figure in my life, always quick with a kind word or a soft touch. But at this moment, her expression told a different story. Her face was hard, her lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes contained a look&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fa-&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to speak, but before I could even say anything, he just turned back. And then said, &quot;Take him to the basement. And keep him there until the trial commences.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His words were cold, and with each one of those, I felt the words I planned to speak stuck in my throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Understood, my Lord.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, someone familiar appeared before me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Excuse my rudeness, Young Lord Lucavion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a man with a wrinkled face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&hellip;..&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The butler of our family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sebastian,&quot; I muttered, recognizing the loyal servant who had always been a part of our household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Please follow me, Young Lord.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gestured for the knights to leave me alone and then took over, guiding me through the corridors of the mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we walked, the grandeur of the place seemed to mock my current state. The tapestries, the chandeliers, the finely crafted furniture&mdash;all reminders of the life I had once known, now seemingly out of reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We descended a narrow staircase that led to the basement. The air grew colder and damper with each step, and the light dimmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basement was a stark contrast to the opulence above. It was a place meant for storage, for things hidden away and forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastian led me to a small, dank cell. He opened the door and gestured for me to enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am sorry, Young Lord,&quot; he said softly, his eyes betraying a hint of sorrow. &quot;This is for your own protection until the trial.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&hellip;..&quot; I nodded, as I knew he couldn&#39;t do anything better than this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since I could see a slight mat on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can check my discord if you want.

(88, 28, 'Chapter 1 Awakening the SSS-Rank Class', 'chapter-1-awakening-the-sss-rank-class', '<p>Valora Continent, East Region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one of the bustling cities of the Inner Circle, Crestford City, a group of young men and women, all around fifteen years old, stood with a mix of seriousness and apprehension etched onto their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weapons of various kinds&mdash;swords, spears, and bows with quivers of arrows&mdash;were slung across their backs as they stood facing the shimmering blue portal before them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armed men and women in military attire formed a protective circle around the portal, standing guard with unwavering vigilance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re really entering a dungeon this time!&quot; one student exclaimed, a mix of excitement and nerves evident in their voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t lie&mdash;I&#39;m nervous too,&quot; another admitted, shifting uneasily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hah! Pathetic,&quot; a confident voice scoffed. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to fear in an awakening dungeon. It&#39;s just goblins.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; someone else muttered. &quot;I&#39;ve never fought a monster before. This will be my first real battle, and honestly&hellip; it&#39;s a little terrifying.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t overthink it,&quot; another chimed in, their tone steady and reassuring. &quot;We&#39;ve been trained for this for five years. The academy made sure we&#39;re prepared for anything the dungeon might throw at us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; another agreed with a firm nod. &quot;All we have to do is stay cautious and stick to what we&#39;ve learned. We&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students continued talking, their voices a mix of apprehension and determination. Some were visibly tense, gripping their weapons tightly, while others stood tall with confidence, trusting in the rigorous teachings of Horizon Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the students stood a striking young man, his silver-white hair flowing effortlessly, catching the light with every movement. His piercing pink eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity, drawing attention even in the midst of the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What? Are you afraid?&quot; Max chuckled, glancing at his trembling friend. He wore a blue shirt over a black t-shirt, with a sword strapped securely to his waist. A small bag was slung across his shoulders behind his back, and a carefully placed dagger rested within easy reach, completing his prepared yet casual appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A little,&quot; Nevin admitted in a quiet voice, his messy black hair falling over his drooped eyes. &quot;Even though this is a no-rank dungeon, the boss monster inside could range from level 3 to level 5. And if luck isn&#39;t on our side&hellip; we might have to face a level 5 boss.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much.&quot; Max chuckled, wrapping his hands around Nevin&#39;s neck. &quot;It&#39;s a goblin-based dungeon, and we all know they are the weakest monsters we could find in the dungeons, so don&#39;t think too much about it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevin sighed and nodded, though the hesitation lingered on his face, clear as day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max shook his head with mild exasperation, seeing his best friend so scared of something as harmless as a no-rank dungeon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Could he planning to&hellip;?&#39; A dreaded thought came to his mind but he immediately shook his head. &#39;No, I am just overthinking this for sure. It must be the no rank dungeons.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No-rank dungeons, often called Awakening Dungeons, were the most basic and weakest dungeons known in the world. These places held no real danger, yet they were vital for every fifteen-year-old, as entering one was the only way to awaken their classes and begin their journey towards transcendence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I wonder what class I&#39;ll awaken...&#39; Max thought, his excitement bubbling under the surface. But suddenly, an image flashed in his mind&mdash;a familiar face, one he hadn&#39;t seen in years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Big Sister... Where are you? It&#39;s been two years&hellip;&#39; His expression shifted abruptly, the spark of delight in his eyes dimming into sorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Are you in some kind of trouble?&#39; he wondered, clenching his fists tightly. &#39;But don&#39;t worry&mdash;I&#39;ll come looking for you soon. Just let me awaken a class first.&#39; His expression turned serious as he hardened his resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years ago, just before his sister awakened, their parents disappeared without a trace, leaving Max and his sister to rely on each other for everything. She had been his anchor, his guide through the storm of uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But two years ago, even that anchor was torn away when his sister stopped sending messages and vanished from his life. The last time he had seen her felt like a lifetime ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, a gnawing void had consumed him&mdash;a need to find her, to uncover the truth about their parents. Every day, that goal burned brighter in his heart, refusing to fade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And therefore, awakening his class had become more than a milestone to him&mdash;it was the first step toward reclaiming his family and uncovering the truth that had haunted him for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Everyone!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, a middle-aged man with golden hair arrived before them. He wore a black suit and black glasses in a stylish fashion. He was the dean of the Horizon Academy, Shaun Wanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Students of Horizon Academy, this is the moment you&#39;ve been waiting for&mdash;the beginning of your journey, the culmination of five years of relentless effort, discipline, and determination,&quot; he declared, his voice ringing with pride and purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have been trained, tested, and prepared for this day. The knowledge you&#39;ve gained about dungeons and their dangers is etched into your very being, so I won&#39;t waste words on what you already know,&quot; he continued, his tone turning solemn, heavy with meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But remember this: a dungeon is an unforgiving place, where the line between glory and tragedy is razor-thin. Be vigilant, for the unknown lurks in every shadow, and the unforeseen waits for no one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kids nodded, hearing the dean. Although they were slightly nervous because it was their first time going into a dungeon and fighting monsters, they knew they were all well-prepared. The nervousness was just a fleeting problem for them, which would go away as soon as they entered the dungeon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright then, go forth and conquer the dungeon,&quot; the dean declared, pointing at the shimmering blue portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s go, Nevin,&quot; Max said to Nevin before heading towards the portal. Nevin nodded as he closely followed behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon they entered the dungeon with all the students of the Horizon Academy and disappeared from the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Max passed through the portal, his head swirled for a moment before he found himself standing in a narrow hall. Torches lined the walls, and a foul stench struck Max. &#39;Damn, this place is smelly.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking around, he found that he wasn&#39;t alone. There were six other students present beside him, but none he was familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just at that moment, a bright blue light appeared in his vision and a voice rang in his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Congratulations to Max Voidwalker for awakening a SSS rank class&mdash;Dimensional Keeper.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max froze, his breath catching in his throat as the shimmering blue notification floated before his eyes. &#39;SSS rank class!&#39; His mind reeled, the words refusing to sink in. His heart pounded in his chest like a war drum as he reread the notification again and again, hoping it wasn&#39;t some cruel glitch or mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This&hellip; this can&#39;t be real&hellip;&quot; he whispered, his voice trembling. He felt like the ground had been ripped out from under him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From F to SSS, the class ranks represented the spectrum of strength, potential, and power in this world. F was useless, D was average, and even an A rank was rare enough to grant someone a lifetime of admiration. But SSS? That was a rank spoken of in myths, something most people wouldn&#39;t even dare to dream about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max had hoped&mdash;prayed&mdash;for something reasonable. A C rank or even a D rank would have been enough to keep his hopes alive. But this? This was beyond anything he could have ever imagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stumbled back, his legs shaky, and clutched his hands together, his fingers trembling. His mind spiraled as the implications began to sink in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;SSS rank&hellip; I&#39;m at the absolute peak of potential&hellip; in the entire world.&quot; He clenched his fists tightly, his knuckles whitening as a surge of exhilaration and disbelief coursed through him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For someone who had always prepared for mediocrity, the realization hit like a tidal wave. A class this rare meant more than strength&mdash;it meant destiny. It meant every gate that had been locked before him was now wide open. His path wasn&#39;t just cleared; it was golden, blinding, endless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A nervous laugh bubbled up in his throat, spilling into the silence. &quot;How&hellip; how did this happen to me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His shock melted into a trembling grin as the gravity of his fortune overwhelmed him. For the first time in his life, Max felt like the world wasn&#39;t just indifferent to him&mdash;it had chosen him. It had handed him the keys to something extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I was always taught to be content with what I had, to find happiness in whatever life gave me. But this&hellip; this changes everything,&#39; Max thought, his fists clenching with newfound resolve. &#39;With a SSS rank class, settling for anything less than the very best would be a disgrace&mdash;to myself, and to the potential this class represents. I can&#39;t waste this gift. I won&#39;t.&#39;</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:35:25', '2025-04-16 05:35:25'),

One for close combat and another for long-range attacks.&#39; Max smiled in satisfaction, assessing his newly acquired skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It&#39;s time for battle.&#39; He unsheathed his sword, secured his bag tightly on his back, and faced the advancing goblins in the hall, ready to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;A total of ten level 1 goblins.&#39; Max noted their weapons: stone knives and short bows. &#39;Good targets indeed.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We should attack. Their numbers are higher, but if we strike first and take out one or two, it&#39;ll be an easy fight,&quot; he said to the academy students, who were equally prepared for battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re ready,&quot; one of the students replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Follow my lead. I&#39;ll create an opening&mdash;then attack.&quot; Max nodded and dashed forward. Some goblins immediately fired arrows at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Let&#39;s see how useful the skill I got from my class is...&#39; He activated Three Dimensional Body, and what he experienced shocked him to the core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This! Damn, is this skill broken or what?!&quot; Max exclaimed in amazement as the skill activated. Suddenly, his perspective shifted&mdash;he could see himself as though from a third-person view, every detail of his surroundings sharpened to perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The faint buzz of insects near the walls, the intricate patterns of spiderwebs in the corners, the glistening moisture clinging to the rough stone of the hall, and even the subtle arc of incoming arrows&mdash;all unfolded before him in a vivid, three-dimensional panorama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was as if the world itself had slowed down, each detail amplified, granting him an unparalleled awareness of his environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This is so cool!&#39; Max rejoiced silently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the arrows closed in, Max could easily perceive their movements and trajectories. He sidestepped, dodging one arrow, while deflecting another with his sword. But four more arrows were heading past him toward the students behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I guess I can help them one last time.&#39; Sighing, he used Magic Bullets, firing four shots that intercepted and destroyed the incoming arrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the arrows were shot down instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max immediately accelerated toward the goblins. With his sword, he struck down the first one, slicing through it from shoulder to waist. Green blood sprayed through the air, but Max dodged the filthy liquid. The goblin&#39;s body glowed red and disappeared, leaving behind a few items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It seems all that academy training wasn&#39;t for nothing,&#39; Max thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noticing two goblins attacking from both sides, he relied on Three Dimensional Body to react. He fired a Magic Bullet at the goblin on his left while slashing horizontally at the one on his right, cutting it in half. Its body vanished moments later, leaving behind drops of loot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goblin hit by the magic bullet writhed in pain, a hole in its body. While not dead, it was incapacitated, slowly succumbing to its injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Fighting is so exhilarating!&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max thought excitedly feeling the satisfaction brewing inside him as he battled the goblins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What about others?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glancing back at the others and noted that they were also handling the goblins. &#39;They are barely managing three goblins, but I&#39;m not complaining.&#39; He dashed forward toward the remaining four goblins.</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:35:54', '2025-04-16 05:35:54'),
(90, 28, 'Chapter 3 Killing Goblins and Leveling up', 'chapter-3-killing-goblins-and-leveling-up', '<p>Bang!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shot a bullet at one of the goblins, hitting it straight in the head and leaving a gaping hole. Approaching the remaining three, he decided to use the Basic Sword Arts skill to finish them off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max attacked as soon as he neared them, executing an upward slash from the ground that split one goblin in half. Swiftly, he moved to his right and thrust his sword straight into the head of the second goblin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It couldn&#39;t dodge, resulting in its head being pierced. However, at that moment, the last goblin attacked with its wooden knife, aiming directly at Max&#39;s left waist. Thanks to his Three Dimensional Body skill, Max could see the attack coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He spun quickly, angling his sword to parry the strike, causing the knife in the goblin&#39;s hand to fly away. Without hesitation, Max swung his sword, slashing the goblin&#39;s neck and causing its head to roll across the floor of the hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This feels so good,&#39; Max thought excitedly as he took deep breaths. Despite the ease with which he defeated the goblins, he felt mentally and physically drained. &#39;I need to level up.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His body possessed only a limited amount of mana since he hadn&#39;t even reached Level 1 in the Novice rank. In fact, his body hadn&#39;t undergone any changes since awakening his class. Only a faint wisp of mana had flowed into him during his awakening, and now most of it was depleted, leaving him exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, he noticed that the other six students had defeated their targets. &quot;The ones I killed are mine; the rest are yours to handle,&quot; he declared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What? That&#39;s not fair!&quot; one of the students protested. &quot;You alone will have seven cores while the six of us get three?!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max sneered. &quot;That&#39;s how it is. I killed seven of them; they&#39;re mine. Simple as that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But there are six of us! How are we supposed to share three cores?&quot; Carl shouted angrily, gritting his teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;I don&#39;t care. What I kill is mine. That&#39;s final.&quot; He began collecting the drops from the goblins he had defeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This guy!&quot; Carl growled in rage, his frustration palpable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Carl, calm down. You know who this guy is, right?&quot; Sil, another student, patted Carl&#39;s shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Carl admitted, still fuming. &quot;And I saw how he alone took down seven goblins while we struggled with three.&quot; Though enraged, he could do nothing but watch helplessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sil sighed. &quot;He&#39;s known as the Overlord at the academy for a reason. He dared to fight the dean&#39;s son, the general&#39;s daughter, and even Henry Reins from the richest family in Crestford City&mdash;and he defeated all of them. They didn&#39;t stand a chance, whether in physical assessments, theory, or combat. After seeing him take down these goblins, I believe he truly deserves that nickname.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmph. He won&#39;t be undefeated for long,&quot; Carl sneered. &quot;William must have awakened a powerful class, and we all know he&#39;ll challenge Max in the dungeon. I bet he&#39;ll finally have a chance to beat him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Carl, that&#39;s impossible,&quot; another student, James, chimed in. &quot;We all know William&#39;s track record against Max&mdash;it&#39;s&hellip; humiliating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl grinned. &quot;I know that, James, but think about it: Max didn&#39;t seem to use any class-related skills in his fight. If we share this intel with William and he defeats Max, we could join his squad. And working under William&mdash;the dean&#39;s son&mdash;would be far better than fumbling around blindly in dungeons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other five students exchanged smiles, nodding in agreement with Carl&#39;s plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Max had collected all the items dropped by the goblins and sat in a corner of the hall. &#39;Seven cores. Even though they&#39;re just basic cores with no rank, they should be enough to get me to Level 1 in the Novice rank.&#39; He glanced at the seven small green orbs on the ground, along with items like rusty daggers, goblin hide scraps, and stale rations&mdash;typical goblin drops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max picked up one of the rusty daggers and inspected its stats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Rusty Dagger]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Rank: Common (Damaged)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Description: A dagger used by goblins for ages, now rusty and broken after its owner&#39;s demise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Huh. These goblins used stone knives, but they dropped daggers&hellip; Interesting,&#39; Max thought, deciding the weapon wasn&#39;t worth using. &#39;I&#39;ll just sell them.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he was about to store the items in his backpack, a sudden realization hit him. The dagger in his hand disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s gone!&quot; Max exclaimed, startled. But before he could panic, he felt the dagger inside his body. &quot;Is it&hellip; inside me?&quot; Closing his eyes, he focused on calling the dagger, and to his amazement, it reappeared in his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Damn, I have my own storage space inside my body!&quot; he muttered, excitement coursing through him. &#39;This Three Dimensional Body skill is more than it seems.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He quickly stored all the items&mdash;except for the seven cores&mdash;in this newfound space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And now, it&#39;s time to level up.&quot; Max picked up one of the cores and began absorbing them one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometime later, Max absorbed the last core, and a notification appeared in his vision:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Congratulations to Max Voidwalker for leveling up to level 1 of Novice Rank.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Max read the notification, a surge of energy coursed through his body. At the same time, he felt an undeniable increase in his physical strength and overall vitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It&#39;s not massive, but I can feel the improvement,&#39; he thought, flexing his fingers and testing his new strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Status.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Max]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Rank: [Novice]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Level: 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Class: [Dimensional Keeper]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Physique: 4.5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Soul: 6.2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Energy: 6</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Skills:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&raquo;Class Skills: [Three Dimensional Body, Dimension of Time]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&raquo;Acquired Skills: [Basic Sword Arts, Magic Bullets]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max frowned as he reviewed his status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;My energy stat increased by 1, physique by 0.5, and soul by just 0.2. Is this good or bad compared to other classes?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every class had its own unique stat increments upon leveling up. These values weren&#39;t standardized, so Max couldn&#39;t determine whether his increases were average, subpar, or exceptional. To him, the overall boost of 1.7 felt underwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaking off his doubts, he turned his attention to a more pressing matter: his second class skill, Dimension of Time. He hadn&#39;t had a chance to use it during the fight with the goblins but was eager to test its effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anything related to time manipulation piqued his interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking around to ensure the other six students were preoccupied, Max silently activated Dimension of Time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moment the skill took effect, his surroundings shifted. The dungeon&#39;s hall, the ground, and even the other students disappeared. In their place was an endless expanse of floating, pure white clouds stretching as far as the eye could see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What is this? How did I get here?&#39; Max&#39;s heart raced as he spun around, taking in the surreal scenery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clouds swirled gently, bathed in a calming light that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. It was as though he&#39;d been transported to a dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This can&#39;t be real&hellip;&#39; Max thought, trying to ground himself. &#39;Did the skill do this?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before he could ponder further, a wooden door materialized in front of him, standing impossibly in the middle of the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the door appeared, a surge of information flooded Max&#39;s mind, making everything clear.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:36:26', '2025-04-16 05:36:26'),
(91, 28, 'Chapter 4 Dimension of Time', 'chapter-4-dimension-of-time', '<p>&#39;I see, so this is only my consciousness that is here. My physical body is still at the exact place where I was before using the Dimension of Time skill,&#39; Max thought as he processed the information in his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From what he understood, this world he now stood in was a gateway to different dimensions. However, for the time being, he couldn&#39;t physically travel there and could only appear here in his soul form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;That means the door in front of me is the gateway to the Dimension of Time,&#39; Max realized, inspecting the wooden door standing in the middle of nowhere in the world of clouds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Since all of this is a result of my class, there&#39;s no harm in checking what&#39;s inside.&#39; He mused, opening the door and stepping through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door closed behind him automatically, and Max found himself standing in a vast room with no visible walls. The place felt endless, and everything around him was pure white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;What is this place?&#39; Max wondered, staring at the mysterious surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, another surge of information flooded his mind, clarifying the true purpose of the Dimension of Time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if this is true or not, but there&#39;s no harm in trying,&quot; Max muttered, pushing his right hand forward and rotating it clockwise, slowly. As he did so, a holographic clock appeared in the white space above him, and the hands of the clock spun at an incredibly high speed. After a moment, everything came to a stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max stopped as well and glanced at the notification that had just popped up before everything halted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Dimension of Time has been set to the first stage.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[First Stage: 1hr = 1 year.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;1hr = 1 year?&#39; Max was shocked when he saw the notification. He understood immediately what it meant. Spending a year in the Dimension of Time would only cost him an hour in the outside world. This meant that one hour in the real world equaled an entire year in this dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is&hellip; Godlike!&quot; Max marveled, amazed by the power of this ability. He had never encountered anything as broken as this before. It was beyond anything he could&#39;ve expected when he first activated the Dimension of Time skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then doesn&#39;t that mean I can train here for years, and only a few hours would pass in the real world?&quot; Max was astounded by the possibilities and couldn&#39;t wait to test it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He closed his eyes for a moment and checked the current state of the dungeon. Everything remained calm in the narrow hall. No more goblins were coming, and the other six students were still waiting for him to take the lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Looks like they&#39;re waiting for me to guide them out of the hall,&#39; Max thought, observing their actions. &#39;This is good. I can use this time effectively.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, Max opened his status and checked the Magic Bullet skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Magic Bullets]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Rank: [Common]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Level: 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;Description: The skill allows the user to conjure and fire basic projectiles made of pure magical energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Level 1?&#39; Max pondered, noting the skill was now at level 1, compared to its previous rank of 0. &#39;At level 1, it allows me to shoot only one magic bullet at a time. Level 2 increases it to 2 bullets, level 3 to 3 bullets, and so on&hellip; But increasing the level not only increases the number of bullets, but also their power.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He understood this, but he also knew that increasing a skill&#39;s level was one of the hardest things for a hunter to accomplish. Most hunters spent more time leveling up their skills than they did hunting or progressing in dungeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;To level up a skill, one must master it. You need to understand how the skill works, its mechanism, and that requires a lot of time,&#39; Max reflected. He decided to try something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forming a shooting stance with his right hand, Max fired a magic bullet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small blue ball of light formed at the tip of his index finger and shot forward like a bullet into the endless white space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was right!&quot; Max rejoiced as he saw his prediction come true. &quot;I can use the skill infinitely here! Since I&#39;m in my soul form, not my physical body, I can use any skill repeatedly without worrying about mana consumption.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His eyes widened in shock as a thought suddenly occurred to him. &quot;Doesn&#39;t that mean this is a perfect place for training my skills?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By repeatedly using the skill, one could get closer to understanding its mechanics, slowly mastering it and leveling it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, this process would take a long time, and without a constant supply of mana crystals, it would be impossible to repeatedly use skills without running out of mana. However, Max didn&#39;t have to worry about time or mana here. The Dimension of Time had solved everything for him. He could just focus on comprehending the skill without concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Even though this is a no-rank dungeon, I still want to kill the boss and the other higher-level goblins. I can&#39;t afford to waste more time here in the entry-level section of the dungeon,&#39; Max thought, deciding to dedicate only three hours to training his Magic Bullet skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three hours was a short time, but in the Dimension of Time, three full years passed for Max. He spent those three years training relentlessly, his focus solely on perfecting the Magic Bullet skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it was difficult for him to do nothing but practice for three years straight, he held on to his will and continued to train over and over again and again until three years finally passed for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I finally mastered Magic Bullet to level 10, but this is too slow,&quot; Max muttered in dissatisfaction. Despite spending three years training, he had only reached level 10. He had expected to have reached level 30 or higher but the reality hit him hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Am I too dumb, or is mastering a skill always this hard?&quot; he wondered in silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood there for a moment, shaking his head with a sigh. &quot;There&#39;s no point in thinking about it now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he was back in the dungeon, in his physical body. However, the sight before him made him break into a cold sweat.</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:36:53', '2025-04-16 05:36:53');

It was then he noticed that the number of goblins surrounding him totaled ten. He also realized that the other six students who came with him were nowhere to be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They must have set me up!&quot; Max deduced how he had ended up in this situation, but instead of frowning, a smile graced his face as he looked at the goblins closing in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If this isn&#39;t the best time to test the level 10 Magic Bullets, then when?&quot; He smiled, holding both his hands out towards the goblins, aiming at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Three Dimensional Body, he didn&#39;t need to worry about his aim. With his omniscient perspective, targeting enemies had become second nature to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Die!&quot; Max laughed, firing ten bullets from his ten fingers simultaneously. The ten bullets, like beams of blue light, shot towards the goblins, penetrating their bodies and tearing chunks of flesh apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goblins didn&#39;t even have time to realize what hit them before their bodies fell, one by one. Moments later, their corpses disappeared, leaving behind a horde of items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max was surprised to see that the bullets tore through the goblins&#39; flesh so effortlessly. He hadn&#39;t expected the strength of the bullets to increase to this level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It seems level 10 for a skill is quite strong,&#39; Max noted, finding this very strange. The academy books mentioned that a skill could be mastered to the highest level of 100, but they also stated it was impossible to achieve that level. However, they didn&#39;t explain why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This lack of clarity left Max unsatisfied with only reaching level 10, even after three years of constant practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Hehe, good. Now, let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve dropped.&#39; Max smiled in satisfaction and began collecting the items left behind by the goblins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the goblins dropped rusty daggers along with their usual goblin hide scraps, stale rations, and cores. He quickly stored everything in his storage space and continued forward, absorbing the cores along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narrow hall he had entered was one of the entry passageways to this no-rank dungeon. Such halls were scattered throughout the dungeon, and the monsters here weren&#39;t particularly strong&mdash;only level 1 of Novice rank. Max knew, however, that the real difficulty lay ahead, beyond the hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max dashed through the narrow corridor, which increasingly resembled a cave the farther he ran. Strangely, he didn&#39;t encounter any goblins and reached the end of the hall after a few minutes of non-stop running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, he saw what appeared to be a village in the distance below him. Thatch huts, wooden pillars, large green leaves for shade, and other rudimentary materials formed the village, which was inhabited by none other than goblins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From his vantage point, Max could see at least fifty goblins roaming the village. Some were battling other students, while others were blissfully unaware of the calamity descending upon them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This is good.&#39; Max smiled and slid down to the ground, heading toward the village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arriving, he was immediately greeted by a sight that made him laugh. The six students who had set him up were fending off a large number of goblins and struggling to defend themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also noticed other groups of students fighting goblins, equally overwhelmed. The goblins at the village&#39;s entrance were level 2 of Novice rank and wielded rusty swords, while most of the students hadn&#39;t even reached level 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;It&#39;s a good place to level up to level 2,&#39; Max thought, smiling as he dashed toward the goblins in the distance. He ignored the six students who had come with him and headed straight to the center of the action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, he saw large number of students barely holding their ground against the goblins, completely suppressed by the monsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arriving, he didn&#39;t attack immediately and stood watching for a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Max? Max is here!&quot; one of the struggling students exclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Max, help us!&quot; another shouted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yeah, Max, please help us. We&#39;re outnumbered, and their strength is higher than ours.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Max, we beg you! Please help us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Only you can help us, Max. Please do something.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max smiled at their pleading faces and responded, &quot;I&#39;ll help, but only if all the drops from the goblins I kill belong to me. Otherwise, pretend I&#39;m not here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students&#39; faces darkened at his demand, but they knew they had no choice. They exchanged glances and reluctantly agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, you can take the drops from the monsters you kill,&quot; one of them said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good.&quot; Max grinned and dashed toward the goblins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching the frontline, he unleashed ten Magic Bullets, killing ten goblins instantly. Some had their heads exploded, while others were left with gaping holes in their bodies. Moments later, the goblins&#39; corpses vanished in red light, leaving behind their drops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students stared in shock at how effortlessly Max dispatched the goblins. The glaring difference in strength between them and Max was undeniable, leaving them feeling ashamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn&#39;t new to them. For five years at the academy, they had been overshadowed by the genius Max Morgan. Now, even in the dungeon, the story remained the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What are you staring at? More goblins are coming!&quot; Max shouted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students turned to see at least fifteen more goblins approaching. Including the ones they were already struggling against, the number quickly rose to thirty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Damn, so many goblins! Look at their strength&mdash;they&#39;re all level 2 of Novice rank.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Level 2? Look closer. Among the fifteen, three are level 3. We&#39;re doomed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we&#39;re already facing level 3 monsters, the dungeon boss must be at least level 5. We&#39;re dead no matter what.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students panicked, knowing the challenge of facing level 3 monsters. They could barely handle level 2, let alone anything stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one person among them had only a smile on his face&mdash;Max.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He dashed toward the incoming goblins, firing ten Magic Bullets at the ones engaging the students. &quot;Don&#39;t forget my condition,&quot; he called out as he passed them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His bullets quickly dispatched the level 2 goblins, leaving the students with only five or so to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Max spared the goblins further back, leaving them for the students to deal with. He wasn&#39;t entirely heartless to take away all the cores and drops from the goblins.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:37:15', '2025-04-16 05:37:15'),
(93, 29, 'Chapter 1: Riezel Brynhart', 'chapter-1-riezel-brynhart', '<p>It was summer and the weather was clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The warm sunlight spilled from the pristine sky, streaming through the window and illuminating the somewhat luxurious room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel sat on an expensive large bed, covered halfway with a blanket. His complexion was slightly pale, but he appeared to be in good spirits, resembling someone recovering from a serious illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing by the bedside was a priest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It seems you&#39;re very energetic today, Mr. Riezel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The priest spoke while holding a notebook in one hand and a quill in the other. He seemed to be observing Riezel with a scrutinizing gaze, sporting a friendly smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh... Really?&quot; Riezel, seemingly oblivious to the scrutiny, nodded in response to the priest. &quot;I do feel much better today. I should be able to get out of bed without any issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s good to hear.&quot; The priest remarked. &quot;Your recovery is much faster than I anticipated. Although we still need to observe, it seems you&#39;ll be up and about soon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, the priest began writing down something on a bound parchment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strange and mysterious symbols, resembling special runes, were swiftly written by the priest on the parchment. Riezel&#39;s attention was drawn to these symbols, not only on the parchment but also on the priest&#39;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The priest wore a golden-trimmed robe, adorned with runic patterns in various corners, giving him an air of mystery and subtle intellect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a precaution, I&#39;ll use magic to check on you.&quot; The priest said gently. &quot;Excuse me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting aside the parchment and quill, the priest raised his hands to Riezel&#39;s chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short while, obscure and hard-to-understand chants echoed from the priest&#39;s lips. A faint yet gentle glow emanated from his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next moment, Riezel could clearly sense his body gradually warming up. It was as if an invisible warm current was flowing into him, enveloping him in unseen warm water. Not only did his body become pleasantly warm, but his mind and energy also improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a moment, the priest ceased his actions and withdrew his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mhm, your body is completely healed. All the previous injuries have been treated.&quot; The priest nodded. &quot;You should rest in bed for today and can start moving around tomorrow.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the priest spoke, there was a subtle sympathy and compassion in his eyes as he gazed at Riezel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these emotions in mind, the priest hesitated for a moment but eventually urged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://novelbin.com/b/looking-forward-to-another-world/chapter-1-riezel-brynhart\" oncontextmenu=\"setRealHref(event)\" onmouseup=\"setRealHref(event)\" real-href=\"https://s.magsrv.com/click.php?d=H4sIAAAAAAAAA1VRTW_bMAz9K7rkaogUZUrHAUUuw9pb77LlJMYcK7DdtBv440e5Hdri6fAePx5FiYkBnRXbYJDLtt3Wg_txwKMe9I5ds56bMq8v8zSsa9OXa825Y8pjPrgHAiR_wPb20u3aE7JzpJFtU4lKVjV8CMisvE_X21jj1VnECjARt0zeyVzuw9SNc50hAL7h0IBrAFiVY2xjDPLhLx5AarOgkN5dIVAR0b6BDSqdh8DBRUmRqHUBTtlGguRjYA_MmcAjQUZts9.Hvxua_zGjMdOZqZTf43w2p7K8piWbrZg0l.0yLOa1LFM2_SXdNlVglnH4O0ymW_7Ml7RsRvYZFeCD9Rx21rY26CNUbuUjv9coiHbqxdXVUPfEPaNCnh9_fan.BH5xeFdrc03ndbnvW5G2yh2iPP2UE6BHm3Mi2wPq92fXU8e.G1oXIfE_2tst4xUCAAA-&amp;cb=e2e_67ff09dd74a912.45406263\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nhận ngay 18 Triệu VND dễ d&agrave;ng</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your body is fine now, but you shouldn&#39;t use magic anymore.&quot; The priest delicately continued. &quot;The damage to the &#39;Gate&#39; inside you is quite severe. It can no longer release magical energy. If you use magic indiscriminately, it may cause magical energy disorder inside you, and then...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The priest left the rest of the sentence unspoken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Riezel responded with a faint smile and said, &quot;I understand my condition. I won&#39;t do anything reckless.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good.&quot; The priest nodded with a slight smile. &quot;In that case, I&#39;ll take my leave. Miss should come to see you later. Please endure for a while and rest in bed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few more instructions, the priest quietly exited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alone in the room, Riezel remained seated on the bed, silent for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hahhh...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few seconds later, Riezel let out an almost imperceptible sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Magic, huh...?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at his much younger-looking hands, which seemed paler than he remembered, Riezel murmured to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Even if you ask me to use it, I probably wouldn&#39;t know where to start...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, in the era and world he came from, the concept of &#39;Magic&#39; was nothing more than a fantasy. It simply didn&#39;t exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet in this world, it seemed to be a perfectly natural and expected phenomenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel couldn&#39;t help but recall events from a month ago. Recalling the moment he woke up, he realized he had arrived in a foreign world, encountering &#39;Magic&#39; for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shock, confusion, and bewilderment of that time now seemed like a distant memory. At least, the current him had fully accepted the fact that he had transmigrated into this fantasy world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a month, he had also come to understand the situation of this world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, this was a world of swords and magic, another world with extraordinary powers and mysterious forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month ago, he arrived in this world and embraced a new identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original owner of this identity was a native of this world, coincidentally sharing the same name as him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only difference was that he was almost thirty in his previous life, while the Riezel of this world had just turned seventeen, undoubtedly much younger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Knock! Knock! Knock!*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Riezel couldn&#39;t help but sink into memories, the door suddenly got knocked by someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Riezel, are you awake?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the door, a voice as light as the wind and as clear as water interrupted his reminiscence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m awake.&quot; Riezel snapped back to reality and responded. &quot;Come in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With those words, the door swung open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing there was a girl of roughly the same age as him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dressed in a convenient and elegant dress, she exuded a noble aura from head to toe. With delicate features and a slender figure, her waist-length bright silver hair adorned her body, not appearing the least bit peculiar. On the contrary, it accentuated her nobility, adding a touch of grace that made every move pleasing to the eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She walked in from the door with an air of natural elegance, radiating an indescribable sense of beauty. Even Riezel, who had grown somewhat accustomed, felt the urge to sigh in admiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, he didn&#39;t do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he watched the girl walking towards him, his face maintained a faint smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re here again, Miss Yuri.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuri Frenzel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the girl&#39;s name and the person who saved his life, bringing him to this place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least, for Riezel, the girl was just that&mdash;a savior. If it were the original owner of his body, meeting her might have rendered him too nervous to speak akin to a typical protagonist in some Japanese novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, he wasn&#39;t this world Riezel. Even though he knew from the original owner&#39;s memory how noble and unattainable the girl before him was, he only held a heart full of gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Yuri shook her head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just call me Yuri; no need to be so formal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl&#39;s voice, just like when she was outside the door, was light as the wind and clear as water, genuinely pleasant. Riezel even thought, somewhat impolitely, that with a voice like hers, she was wasting her talent for not becoming a singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Judging by your appearance, it seems you&#39;ve recovered quite well.&quot; Yuri sat down at his bedside, observing him carefully. &quot;How are you feeling? Can you get out of bed?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tomorrow should be fine...&quot; Riezel replied, expressing gratitude. &quot;Thanks for your care, Miss Yuri. I&#39;ll repay this favor sooner or later.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve said it before, no need to be so formal...&quot; Yuri sighed lightly. &quot;Your current situation is somewhat related to me. It&#39;s strange to see you so polite now. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if you were like in the beginning?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe recalling &#39;that time&#39; improved her mood somehow. But this left him somewhat speechless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back then, his attitude was far from good. He just couldn&#39;t help it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he first transmigrated into this world, he woke up in bed, in excruciating pain with severe injuries all over, while an unknown girl stood by his side. His initial reaction was naturally filled with hostility and caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it weren&#39;t for later realizing that something extraordinary happened to his body, Riezel would have thought he stumbled upon a dirty conspiracy, and some people were trying to harm him again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memories from his previous life flowed through, causing a slight ache in his heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Thinking about it, my situation in this world doesn&#39;t seem much different from my previous world.&#39; Riezel self-mocked in his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not knowing what he was thinking, Yuri noticed his sudden silence and changed the topic, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Still no way to repair your Gate?&quot; Yuri inquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it seemed like a change of topic, what she brought up was, to some extent, more sensitive than their previous conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No.&quot; Riezel maintained his calm expression. &quot;The damage seems quite extensive, with no signs of recovery. I was just warned not to use magic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Really...?&quot; Yuri sounded somewhat regretful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this world, the ability to use magic directly determines one&#39;s social status. To use magic, one needed a certain amount of magical energy. Magical energy was the fuel for magic. Without it, magic was impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, people in this world were born with magical energy. The difference lay in the quantity&mdash;some had more, some had less, and some had enough to use magic, while others did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The so-called &#39;Gate&#39; referred to a kind of nerve in the human body with magical properties. It served as a switch, a channel, and a storage for storing magical energy&mdash;the source of using magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the &#39;Gate&#39; was damaged, it became difficult to call upon magical energy. In severe cases, the stored magical energy could be lost entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His Gate was damaged. What&#39;s more? It was intentionally damaged by someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Have you found out who did it?&quot; Riezel asked nonchalantly. &quot;Who wants to harm me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the reason he ended up in this place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&mdash;or rather, his body&#39;s original owner, was murdered a month ago. He was severely injured and didn&#39;t make it through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel thus transmigrated, took the dead body, saved by Yuri, and spent a whole month recovering in this luxurious mansion as Riezel Brynhart.</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:37:53', '2025-04-16 05:37:53'),
(94, 29, 'Chapter 2: Dimensional Magic Cube', 'chapter-2-dimensional-magic-cube', '<p>Riezel Brynhart was a genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not because of his keen insight or exceptionally high innate skill, but simply because the world had favored him, giving him a natural advantage over many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn&#39;t some influential figure with a background that reached the skies. On the contrary, he hailed from the ignored countryside, where generations of his family were farmers, and even his grandfather was a slave. One can easily imagine how humble his origins were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, Riezel was undeniably fortunate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was born with an abundance of magical energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing this, unwilling to be just a farmer or a slave, he abandoned the plan to be handed over to a lord by his grandfather and family. Escaping from the obscure rural territory of his childhood, he made his way to the estate of a great noble. There, he participated in the entrance test for the National Magic School, which happened to be held there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His naturally powerful magical energy effortlessly caught the attention of the higher-ups at the magic school. He was smoothly ushered into the continent&#39;s most prestigious academy, becoming a sensation in the renowned institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel Brynhart&#39;s reputation as a genius stemmed precisely from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His insight wasn&#39;t extraordinary, and his innate skill in magic wasn&#39;t exceptionally high. Still, because of his outstanding innate magical energy, he became the envy of many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this was because in this world, though everyone had magical energy, its quantity was a natural talent determined at birth and couldn&#39;t be changed through effort later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the amount of magical energy one&#39;s body possessed at birth determined their magical ability throughout their life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This meant that many people were destined from birth to never become magicians, no matter how hard they tried. Conversely, some who were blessed with an abundance of magical energy could effortlessly become magicians, performing high-rank, high-powered magic that others could only dream of, making them so-called geniuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel Brynhart was one such person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was praised by many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was complimented by many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People gathered around him, and even some highly influential figures tried to win his favor. The kingdom itself valued him greatly; it was said that even the king remembered his name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the question arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens to a humble, inexperienced country boy, who has been living a simple life, when he comes to the big city and is showered with compliments, support, and praise from everyone? After experiencing the temptations of the dazzling world, what does he become?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will he, like the main characters in some novels, strive hard, resist all temptations, and become the strongest, fundamentally changing his fate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least, Riezel could confidently say one thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&mdash;In this kind of environment, the possibility of a person turning bad is countless times greater than the possibility of turning good.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original owner of the body knew this well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst the praise, compliments, flattery, and support from those around him, the original owner easily forgot about hard work, forgot about diligence, and fell into the sugar-coated bullets of others, unable to free himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was that the original owner became completely ignorant and incompetent, relying on the so-called &#39;talent&#39; as an excuse. He spent his days indulging in pleasure with some noble children. Although he didn&#39;t reach the point of bullying and oppressing others, he gradually became so arrogant that no one else mattered. He became self-conceited, thinking he had surpassed everyone else, unwilling to associate with those of humble birth, and spent his days fooling around with a group of noble children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the calamity that would wake the original owner from his dream arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a night just a month ago, after fooling around with a group of noble children and preparing to return to the academy, he was attacked. He not only suffered severe injuries but also had the &#39;Gate&#39; in his body destroyed, rendering him unable to use magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here, the fall from grace of this genius began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding this, the original owner met a tragic end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His final thoughts were not of regret for everything he had done so far, but rather an unwillingness to accept the future of returning to the days as a lackey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In such a situation, Riezel arrived and replaced this world Riezel, then brought by Yuri, who mistakenly thought he had been successfully rescued, back to her mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this body&#39;s original owner, Riezel had no sympathy or pity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This outcome could be considered self-inflicted...&#39; Riezel remarked inwardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his previous life, Riezel&#39;s environment was somewhat similar to the original owner&#39;s, filled with sweet words and flattery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, unlike the original owner, Riezel saw through the true faces behind the smiling facades of those people, feeling disgusted by their ulterior motives and the environment he was in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, having left his original world and entered another world was a kind of liberation for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind, Riezel originally had no intention of investigating the attack on his body&#39;s original owner. However, the problem seemed to be not as simple as he had imagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve ordered an investigation.&quot; Yuri said while slightly furrowing her brows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No results?&quot; Riezel asked calmly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing her reaction, he immediately guessed the outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure enough, she nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The attacker is deeply hidden. Whether it&#39;s the attack that injured you a month ago or the assassination attempt half a month ago, the attackers are hired underground figures. Investigating them leads nowhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, just half a month ago, Riezel once again faced an attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, he thought that the reason for the attack on the original owner was simply due to offending someone or being envied by someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But during the time he was recuperating in Yuri&#39;s mansion, someone infiltrated this mansion. Taking advantage of the night when everyone was asleep, they attempted to assassinate him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, although this mansion belonged only to Yuri, the security measures were well in place. There were always guards patrolling, and a magic alarm was set up. She was able to reach his room at the first sign of the assassin infiltrating and apprehending them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, he wouldn&#39;t be lying in bed now; he would probably be in a grave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was clearly abnormal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To hire an assassin who can infiltrate even this mansion, the other party is not only deeply hidden but also has a complicated identity.&quot; Riezel commented calmly, making Yuri somewhat surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, his observation was correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though it was just a mansion, the ability to infiltrate here meant that the other party had significant skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, this was where she, Yuri Frenzel, resided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone who could hire such a skilled assassin would undoubtedly have a strong background, both in identity and ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really want to know what reason could make such a figure target me...&quot; Riezel said while smiling calmly at Yuri, seemingly unaffected by his precarious situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuri deeply looked at him before speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will continue to investigate. Before that, you can rest assured here. Although rare, there are methods to temporarily mend the completely damaged Gate. I will watch for you temporarily; I hope you don&#39;t give up on yourself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot; Riezel nodded without showing approval or disapproval. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No need.&quot; Yuri smiled lightly, as graceful as an orchid in full bloom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few more exchanges, she stood up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I won&#39;t disturb you; you rest well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, Yuri gracefully moved away, leaving behind a faint fragrance as she exited the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel watched her depart, but his mind was not as calm as it appeared on the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Who could it be?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tried to recall the original owner&#39;s memories, suspecting one person after another among those the original owner knew. Nobles and commoners ignored by the original owner, even the people from the countryside when the original owner was still living there&mdash;all fell under suspicion, yet without any concrete result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;The clues are too few.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original owner&#39;s memories might not be reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, the mastermind behind the scenes was someone the original owner had overlooked, perhaps a person so easily forgettable that he didn&#39;t even bother to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;If it was me, I would never allow such a thing to happen...&#39; Riezel thought to himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life experiences from his previous life had instilled in him the habit of suspecting anyone, never intentionally ignoring anyone. Also, because of these experiences, he deeply understood one thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;The other party surely hasn&#39;t given up; they will continue to target me, sending people to kill me again and again...&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuri&#39;s identity was prestigious, and the environment she was in was extremely sensitive and crucial. The fact that the other party was willing to send someone to assassinate him showed their strong determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This lack of security left him, who had similarly suffered from such situations in his previous life, feeling very uneasy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Next time, who will they send?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Will they be more powerful than the last assassin?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Will Yuri be able to come to my rescue in time?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each question told Riezel how unstable and unsafe his current situation was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Yuri saving him wasn&#39;t without reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If not for some reason, given the lack of interaction between his body&#39;s original owner and her, who even seemed to be in a somewhat formal relationship, she would not have sheltered him for a whole month for free, considering it good enough to save his life when he was near death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel didn&#39;t want to entrust his life and death to someone else&#39;s hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had to protect himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had to find a way to escape this powerless situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this was a difficult task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his &#39;Gate&#39; completely damaged, Riezel couldn&#39;t even use the most basic magic.

Please be careful.]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon receiving these messages from the Dimensional Magic Cube, Riezel was stunned on the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, the reason he was stunned had nothing to do with anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the form of the dimensional travel or the difference in time ratios, upon his initial encounter with the Dimensional Magic Cube, he gained relevant information from its usage instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, concerning the difference in time ratios between the two worlds, Riezel had long been aware, even understanding that this dimensional travel would only send his &#39;consciousness&#39; and not his entire being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was why he regarded the Dimensional Magic Cube as a reliance and remained calm from start to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the difference in time ratios, even if the dimensional channel exists for only one day in the main world, in another world, Riezel would have plenty of time to explore and develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the dimensional travel only sent his consciousness, even if he were to die when he was in another world, he wouldn&#39;t be affected. At most, it would mark the end of this particular journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, he could fully utilize the difference in time ratios and the absolutely safe situation to seek power and solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was his plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he did not anticipate that the dimensional channel opened by the Dimensional Magic Cube would ultimately connect to such a world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Is it really that world? Danmachi?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel expressed both surprise and delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surprise was due to the unexpected destination of the dimensional travel not being some unfamiliar world but a world he had seen, experienced, and known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The delight stemmed from this revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, in this world, while Riezel may not know it like the back of his hand, he was familiar with a considerable amount of information, even the so-called &#39;plot&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, he could save time and energy by leveraging his understanding of this world, and obtaining what he wanted based on that knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, this world had what he desired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a fantasy world where all races lived together in harmony, primarily composed of &#39;Humans&#39; and &#39;Demi-Humans&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, Humans were not the only intelligent beings; various races such as Dwarves, Beastmen, Pallum, Elves, and Amazonesses coexist. Even beings like &#39;Gods&#39; were present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These &#39;Gods&#39;, for the sake of experiencing mortal life, departed their mundane heavens devoid of any entertainment, voluntarily sealed their divine powers known as &#39;Arcanum&#39;, and descended to the lower world where Humans and Demi-Humans reside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They grant mortals the power called &#39;Falna&#39; to attract them to join their established familial factions known as &#39;Familia&#39; and establish a foothold in the lower world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I remember, once receiving Falna, one could enhance their abilities, level up, and grow stronger by defeating monsters, enemies, and opponents, gaining &#39;Excelia&#39; in the process, akin to &#39;EXP&#39; in a game.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Riezel, who currently had neither the time nor inclination for slow and steady practice, this method of gaining power was undoubtedly the perfect solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining a Familia and receiving Falna&mdash;that was his swift path to getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defeating enemies meant getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjugating monsters meant getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even a bit of training meant getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having Excelia meant getting stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;This first world for dimensional travel seems tailor-made for me.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realizing this, while not overly excited, Riezel couldn&#39;t help but feel a subtle surge of anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;The time ratio is 1:100, right?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, one day in the main world was equivalent to a hundred days in another world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dimensional travel&#39;s time limit was just one day in the main world. This meant, under the current time ratio, Riezel could spend a hundred days in another world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Can I break free from my current trouble in almost three and a half months, assuming everything goes smoothly?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel didn&#39;t know. But he had no other choice right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with determination, he directed his consciousness towards the dimensional channel in his mind, allowing it to pass through the dimensional channel and begin to travel to another world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Riezel himself, he remained lying in bed, seemingly in a deep sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To onlookers, he appeared to be nothing more than having a peaceful sleep.

This made him fit seamlessly into this world, everything appearing so natural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a while, he laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He laughed genuinely for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s start with this world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muttering those words, Riezel took a step forward and began his journey in another world.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:39:13', '2025-04-16 05:39:13');

Some Familias even existed and operated outside of Orario in the form of nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was just the basic difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one delved deeper, factors such as the personality of the God who established the Familia, the internal environment of the Familia, and the presence of negative influences had to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one accidentally joined a God that saw their Familia and children as money-making machines or as mere entertainment, it was basically a game over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, Gods in this world voluntarily sealed their Arcanum as they descended to the lower world for the sake of playing. Most of them were all about pleasure and entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing which Familia to join required careful consideration and prudent selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;If I remember correctly, in Orario, the strongest seems to be Loki Familia, Freya Familia, and Ganesha Familia, right?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prefix name of a Familia referred to the God who established it. For example, the founder of Loki Familia was the famous God of Mischief from Norse Mythology&mdash;Loki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unlike the male counterpart in true mythology, Loki in this world was a female.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Riezel recalled the long-lost original work, he strolled through the streets and&nbsp;suddenly found himself in a somewhat familiar place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just beyond the bustling main street, a much taller and larger building than the surrounding area appeared. Several high-rise towers overlapped, resembling a mountain of swords, and a flag fluttered atop the central tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flag depicted a clown as if showing a comical smile to the people on the ground, particularly eye-catching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The somewhat familiar building and flag made Riezel stop in his tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Loki Familia, huh?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clown flag, precisely the symbol of Loki Familia, one of Orario&#39;s strongest Familias, Riezel unexpectedly found himself in the heart of their base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Could it be... this is fate?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>===</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the sun set, Orario was enveloped in the glow of the evening sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people finishing a day&#39;s work and the adventurers returning from the dungeon strolled through the streets with a mix of exhaustion and involuntary relaxation, transforming the city into the embrace of the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm~ Hmm~ Hmm~&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a corner of the street bathed in the twilight hues, a figure of a woman with long, casually tied crimson hair and eyes squinted walked with an elegant yet strangely messy appearance. Though possessing a refined countenance, she exuded an air of nonchalance and a lack of seriousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humming a tune, she strolled casually but her hums faded as she lost interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ugh, so boring~ Wandered around all day and found nothing amusing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman grumbled in a tone that sounded oddly down-to-earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All the kids are off on expeditions, and only a few are left at home. And they all claim to have work to do, refusing to come out and play with me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s not the worst part. I went out to have some fun myself, and those guys who are usually desperate for a party seem to have taken some strange medicine. Not a single one showed up today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Boring, just plain boring~!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Aah~ I want to play patty-cake with cute girls and have some lovey-dovey time with Ais.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking with a swagger, the woman continued her lamentations, making remarks that were far from flattering, causing pedestrians to instinctively steer clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unaware of the effect of her remarks on others, she continued to sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s just go home and have a drink. If I calculate the time correctly, everyone should be back soon. I can endure a few more days.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After saying that, the woman turned into the road beyond the bustling main street and reached the mountain of swords-shaped buildings&mdash;Twilight Manor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the highest tower amid the multitude of towers, a flag depicting a clown still swayed in the wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, the laid-back woman stopped in her tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For no particular reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It just, on the manor&#39;s gate, someone stood there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;A human boy?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman recognized the person&#39;s race and gender, and her initially squinted eyes widened slightly.

Yet, the boy remained standing by the gate, openly locking eyes with her. His figure showed no signs of wavering, and this display immediately piqued her interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;I see... Is he waiting for me?&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an instant, the woman seemed to see through the boy&#39;s intentions and burst into hearty laughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her smile, reminiscent of the clown&#39;s whimsical grin hanging on the flag at the highest point of Twilight Manor, added an inexplicable touch to the atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Interesting...&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When such a feeling arose in the woman&#39;s heart, there was no suspense about what action should be taken next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see something interesting and want to get closer was the nature of Gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tired of the heavenly life, willingly sealed their Arcanum to pursue entertainment in the lower world and roamed freely like mortals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman&mdash;or rather, the Goddess fully played out this trait, walking straight toward the human boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, kid, what are you doing here by yourself?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norse Goddess&mdash;Loki, greeted the boy who had just arrived in this world today, standing nonchalantly at the entrance of her Familia&#39;s base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, the boy simply flashed a calm and steady smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have no place to go.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s what the boy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simple and concise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it was not a particularly glorious situation, the boy&#39;s attitude was so calm and seemed almost indifferent to his own unfortunate circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Loki knew he wasn&#39;t lying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though her Arcanum was sealed, as a Goddess who had survived for countless eons, her divine insight and knowledge were sufficient to see through many things that mortals thought were profound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on this, it was almost impossible for mortals to hide something from her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you want me to take you in?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comical smile on Loki&#39;s face seemed to be getting thicker as she asked that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; The boy nodded straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good!&quot; Loki said joyfully without any hesitation while still grinning. &quot;From today on, you are my child!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was this just a whim of the Goddess, or was there a deeper meaning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was only one thing certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel had successfully joined Loki Familia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just a few words.</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:39:47', '2025-04-16 05:39:47'),

In simpler terms, it was Loki&#39;s room, filled with all sorts of odds and ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were expensive-looking quill pens on the table, along with mysterious crystals sporting a faint rainbow hue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the walls hang ancient-looking shoes and hats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bed was almost buried under heaps of thick books and ornate short swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the corners of the room were stacked with small storage units, containing bottles of various shapes and colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by Loki, Riezel arrived in this room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Come in.&quot; Loki casually pushed open the door and strode into the room. &quot;Excuse the mess.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel, feeling oddly polite, first stood at the doorway, bowed slightly, then entered the divine room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Come, sit here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loki was quite enthusiastic, resembling a child who just got a new toy. In high spirits, she brought a chair for Riezel, sweeping aside the various clutter, and invited him to take a seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observing the carefree and unrestrained Goddess, Riezel couldn&#39;t help but find it peculiar even though he was aware of her personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, even in his previous life, entities associated with the term &#39;God&#39; were highly revered, and not to be treated with any disrespect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silently contemplating this, he sat down in response to her invitation, while glancing around the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Loki kept a close eye on him from beginning to end, wearing the always mischievous smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sorry, most of the kids from the Familia are out on a dungeon expedition, couldn&#39;t throw you a lively welcome party.&quot; Loki said with a cheerful grin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No problem.&quot; Riezel withdrew his gaze from the surroundings and shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m not much of a fan of lively gatherings, so this is fine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Uh-huh, I can tell. You&#39;re that kind of person.&quot; Loki nodded approvingly, then added, &quot;But, whether you like it or not, now that you&#39;ve joined my Familia, you&#39;re part of the family. Being too isolated won&#39;t do, y&#39;know?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know.&quot; Riezel smiled calmly at Loki. &quot;If it&#39;s someone worth interacting with, I won&#39;t isolate myself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Someone worth interacting with, huh...?&quot; Loki&#39;s expression turned subtle, but she shrugged it off. &quot;Okay then, for now, let&#39;s leave it at that. I don&#39;t want to preach to a newcomer. We can save that for later.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, she propped her chin with one hand, lifted one foot to rest on the other thigh, and gazed at him with her narrowed eyes and the ever-present smile on her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, you&#39;re still free, and haven&#39;t received any blessings at all, yeah?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Loki&#39;s question, Riezel deliberately ignored her probing gaze and nodded naturally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t received any blessings since I just arrived in Orario today. Before this, I haven&#39;t met any Gods or been a part of any Familia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel knew that lying was futile in the presence of this world&#39;s Gods. So, he wouldn&#39;t engage in any meaningless deception; every word and action appeared remarkably honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I guess so...&quot; Loki smirked. &quot;If you had anything special, you wouldn&#39;t be standing there at the gate and waiting for me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is Loki Familia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the strongest Familias in Orario, a faction second to none in this world and dubbed as one of the strongest Familias of Orario, alongside Freya Familia, known far and wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such a powerful Familia, there was no shortage of people wanting to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, joining Loki Familia wasn&#39;t as easy as it seemed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to mention Loki Familia, even a weaker Familia would have some requirements for new members to join. They wouldn&#39;t just accept anyone randomly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, if you want to join a famous Familia, you must have some exceptional qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve been part of a Familia before and received blessings, then it&#39;s about your strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve never been part of a Familia or never received blessings, then it&#39;s about your potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former was another matter, but the latter usually depended on race and innate skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, in this world, there were beings known as &#39;Demi-Humans&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beastmen had naturally keen senses and various innate skills depending on the classification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dwarves were widely recognized for their strength and stamina, surpassing other races in both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazonesses, despite being only female, were known for their combat prowess and indomitable vitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elves were magical races, able to perform miracles and mysteries to some extent even without receiving Falna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to Demi-Humans, Humans didn&#39;t have many special traits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In such a situation, if Riezel, as a mere human, approached Loki Familia, one of the strongest, expressing a desire to join, he would likely be rejected at the door by the gatekeeper without even having the chance to meet the God of the Familia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, he was well aware of this, so he never considered a direct visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He knew what kind of situation he would face, which was why he chose to wait at the gate for Loki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than dealing with mortals who assessed people&#39;s worth in a very practical way, it was better to face Gods who acted on whims and were often unpredictable. That way, he could achieve his goal more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riezel made this decision based on that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, he even prepared himself mentally for a long resistance, ready to wait for days. He couldn&#39;t believe that Loki, known as a free-spirited Goddess, would stay confined within the base forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turned out, his idea was correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s get those clothes off first.&quot; Loki said while dragging a chair and sitting behind Riezel. &quot;Just the top will do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He nodded and unbuttoned his shirt, exposing his back to her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tch, tch, nice skin. Better than those little girls&#39; back in our Familia.&quot; Loki remarked, marveling at Riezel&#39;s bare back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, she casually picked up a box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the box was a needle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she took the needle in hand, she began to speak while still gazing at his bare back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What do you know about &#39;Falna&#39;?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loki&#39;s question made Riezel pause for a moment, lost in thought. After a while, he spoke cautiously, relying on his memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as I know, it&#39;s a power that uses the &#39;sacred text&#39;, the language of the Gods, engraving it onto the mortal body through God&#39;s blood as a medium which will enhance their abilities. This power acts as a catalyst, turning the experiences gained through various actions into powerful abilities, accelerating and amplifying them to facilitate rapid growth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yep.&quot; Loki agreed with his explanation. &quot;The Excelia, invisible to the naked eye of the mortals, is essentially your own history. We Gods use &#39;Falna&#39; to extract this history, turning it into nourishment for your growth. It allows you to grow at an unimaginable speed and get stronger. That&#39;s the only role we Gods play in the lower world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, Loki pricked her own finger with the needle, and a drop of blood oozed out. Using the blood, she drew a pattern on Riezel&#39;s back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could feel her fingertip sliding on his back. However, his attention was soon diverted by her voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With sacred text as the guide and the blood of the Gods as the medium, we depict your abilities in a concrete numerical way. So, &#39;Falna&#39; is also known as &#39;Status&#39;. Anyone who can read the sacred text can visually confirm the abilities of those blessed by us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loki&#39;s voice seemed to distance itself, becoming mysterious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Status is basically divided into four parts&mdash;&#39;Basic Abilities&#39;, &#39;Development Abilities&#39;, &#39;Magic&#39;, and &#39;Skill&#39;, with &#39;Level&#39; being the most crucial.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Development abilities aside, that&#39;s an extra thing you may get when leveling up. You won&#39;t have it right after receiving the blessing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Basic abilities are &#39;Strength (STR)&#39;, &#39;Endurance (END)&#39;, &#39;Dexterity (DEX)&#39;, &#39;Agility (AGI)&#39;, and &#39;Magic (MAG)&#39;, a total of five. Each has ranks from &#39;S&#39; to &#39;I&#39;, indicating the strength of the ability. The closer to S, the stronger the ability.&quot;&nbsp;<em>{T/N: I&#39;ll use abbreviations for basic abilities to differentiate them more easily from other terms.}</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Level, as the name suggests, is the most direct standard for distinguishing strength. The higher the level, the stronger. The improvement in basic abilities compared to level is incomparable. Basic abilities only improve one aspect, while level improvement is a complete body and mind evolution. You can think of leveling up as mortals approaching our level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As for magic and skill, the former is a power that can trigger supernatural phenomena. Originally, only a few magic races could use it. But after receiving the blessing, people of any race have a chance to possess it, from one to three. The latter brings special effects under certain conditions, not as visually powerful as magic races but without quantity limits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loki&#39;s voice took on an inexplicable inducement as it echoed in Riezel&#39;s ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Speaking of which, both magic and skill, when inspired through Falna, are intimately related to yourselves. They are directly linked to your interests and approval of something, almost like materializing the power of imagination and longing in your heart. You can try asking yourself, recalling your life; maybe something will be triggered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Loki&#39;s explanation, Riezel involuntarily began to recall his previous life, a life that was not worth looking back on.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:40:18', '2025-04-16 05:40:18'),
(98, 30, 'Chapter 1', 'chapter-1', '<p>Lin Yangfang Market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As dawn broke, the mist hadn&#39;t dispersed entirely, veiling the market in a gauzy white haze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enclosed by a gray stone wall, a small courtyard spanned roughly three yards long by two wide. Most of it was dark soil, with a narrow path of blue stone running through the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that dark soil, low-grade spirit plants thrived, nurtured by the night&#39;s mist, their vibrant greenery stretching lazily under the fog&#39;s gentle touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a creak, the door of a stone house at the end of the blue stone path swung open, and a teenager emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixteen or seventeen, clad in gray, tall and handsome with bright, clear eyesthis was Lu Xuan, who had inexplicably awakened in this young body, leaving behind an ordinary life on Earth to become an insignificant spirit plant cultivator in the vast world of cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After navigating initial confusion and fear, Lu Xuan gradually adapted to his new identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with nothingno parents, no supportmediocre aptitude, at the second level of Qi cultivation, he leased a plot of spirit farmland in the market. He toiled to grow spirit grass and medicine, striving to survive in this cutthroat world of cultivation, fraught with danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin mist in the courtyard helped clear Lu Xuan&#39;s just-awakened mind as he inspected the spirit plants carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were about twenty or thirty plants, each with spaces between them, standing a foot tall, their slender leaves adorned with faint white fluorescence, like stars in the pale mist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were Firefly Grass, first-grade spirit plants, relatively easy to cultivate. When matured, they served as ingredients for several healing elixirs, widely used in the cultivation world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the Firefly Grass, there were two trees in the yard, both Lunar Erosion Trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Lu Xuan&#39;s attentive care, the Lunar Erosion Trees, also first-grade spirit plants, flourished. They stood taller than his head, bearing dozens of silver-white fruits resembling crescent moons, gradually maturing into full moons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mature Lunar Erosion Fruits could be consumed to slightly boost the spiritual energy in lower-level cultivators or used in refining precious elixirs like the Elemental Nourishing Elixir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both plant species were thriving, yet a hint of worry crossed Lu Xuan&#39;s face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hurried to the west side of the courtyard, crouched, and carefully turned over a leaf of one Firefly Grass near the stone wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, the back of the leaf bore faint black threads, almost imperceptible without Lu Xuan&#39;s keen observation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Compared to yesterday, there&#39;s notably more of these black lines.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan compared silently, gazing at the Firefly Grass invaded by these threads, sighing softly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of days ago, while tending to the plants, he noticed this particular Firefly Grass near the wall acting strangely. After an extensive search, he discovered these black threads on the underside of its leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They seemed inseparable from the Firefly Grass, firmly intertwined, and their origin remained a mystery to Lu Xuan, a mere novice in the world of spirit plants, lacking knowledge about these black threads&#39; nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unable to find a specific remedy, he cautiously separated the threads from the leaf using his internal energy and concentration. Exhausted, he managed to clean them away but found more the next day, multiplying with each passing day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At this rate, in a day or two, this Firefly Grass will be entirely overrun by these black threads, possibly spreading to nearby ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking this, Lu Xuan felt troubled, standing still in his tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He considered uprooting this Firefly Grass to prevent contamination of the neighboring plants, but upon careful thought, he dismissed the idea. After all, the nature and effects of these black threads remained unclear. Removing one plant might not stop the rest from being affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As things stand, I&#39;ll have to find an experienced, legitimate cultivator from the market to help solve this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All the spirit stones I&#39;ve saved... I was planning to pay the rent for this farmland in two months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan, a second-level Qi cultivator, couldn&#39;t wholly own a piece of farmland. This small plot in his courtyard was leased from a mid-level Qi cultivator in the market, demanding a substantial amount of spirit stones every month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the foreseeable future, I&#39;ll have to tighten my belt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood resolute, aware that when the plants matured, he could sell them to shops or fellow cultivators for spirit stones, beyond what he needed for rent and daily cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But seeking help from a seasoned cultivator would require a hefty investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan made up his mind, surveying his surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A black thorn hedge ran along the gray stone wall, providing some defense with its sharp spikes. However, its defensive capability was limitedit could deter gentlemen but not villains, let alone protect against mysterious creatures eyeing the plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After resolving this, I&#39;ll need to save some spirit stones to set up a protection array. Relying solely on this straw puppet to guard the farmland is impractical.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He glanced at the straw puppet in the corner of the yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing three feet tall, leaning against the wall, made of unknown hay, it had a disproportionately large, deformed head with a gray hay lump on top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan bought it second-hand from a stall in the market, claiming it originated from the Thousand Mechanisms Sect, known for basic functions and guarding lower-grade farmlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supposedly, if it sensed a cultivator or beast entering the farmland, it would alert the owner. But whether it worked or not depended on both its condition and Lu Xuan&#39;s reclusive nature since his arrival here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan scowled at the lumped puppet, his Qi surging, creating a subtle spirit rain that fell onto the Firefly Grass and Lunar Erosion Trees, enhancing their growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every cultivator learned this essential technique, infusing subtle spiritual energy into mist to nurture the plants for healthy growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm? This Firefly Grass has entered its maturation phase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After irrigating each plant, Lu Xuan noticed one Firefly Grass emitting intermittent flashes, seemingly ready to detach from its leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurrying inside, he fetched a white jade box and carefully harvested the grass, placing it within. The jade box slowed the loss of spiritual power within the plant, preserving its medicinal properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Lu Xuan closed the box, about to leave, he noticed a fist-sized white orb remaining where the Firefly Grass had grown, radiating faintly with dispersed spiritual light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiously, he reached out, lightly touching the orb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an instant, countless specks of light rushed into his palm, triggering a thought in his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Harvested one Firefly Grass, gained three months&#39; worth of cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---------------</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:43:35', '2025-04-16 05:43:35'),
(99, 30, 'Chapter 2', 'chapter-2', '<p>A fleeting thought crossed Lu Xuan&#39;s mind, and he sensed something peculiar within his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The once tranquil spiritual energy surged suddenly, coursing through Lu Xuan&#39;s meridians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a moment, the uncontrolled spiritual energy gradually subsided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan carefully sensed the changes within him, a hint of joy appearing on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His cultivation had skyrocketed, equivalent to the arduous three months of daily practice. He was now just a step away from breaking through to the third level of Qi cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After being here for so long, the golden finger has finally arrived,&quot; Lu Xuan rejoiced. In his past life, both mentally and physically, he was ordinary. Occupying this body with its average aptitude and background, without external aids, he wasn&#39;t sure how he could have thrived in the realm of cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stream of information emerged in his mind, granting him an understanding of everything about the white luminous mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any spirit plants or herbs he personally planted and nurtured, upon maturation and harvest, would yield rewards in the form of the white luminous mass. From this mass, various items like cultivation, artifacts, techniques, and elixirs could be obtained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The richness of the rewards depended on several factors: his involvement during the growth of the spirit plants, their type, grade, and their condition upon maturity, all influenced the size of the rewards from the white luminous mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mass was visible and touchable only to him; others couldn&#39;t see it. Harvesting without personally planting the spirit plants wouldn&#39;t yield the luminous mass rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, by successfully planting a spirit plant, I not only get the plant itself but also additional rewards from the luminous mass?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That means double the yield, double the happiness, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Lu Xuan gazed at the thriving Firefly Grass and Lunar Erosion Tree in the soil, envisioning multiple white luminous masses shimmering towards him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My achievements today are solely due to my consistent efforts in cultivating and diligently caring for these spirit plants,&quot; Lu Xuan couldn&#39;t help but muse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sensed that since the appearance of the white luminous mass, numerous changes had occurred in the spirit field where the spirit plants grew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan&#39;s heart was elated as he concentrated his mind on a Firefly Grass nearing completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An almost invisible progress bar appeared above the Firefly Grass, nearly reaching full capacity, indicating that this particular grass was about to reach full maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A message flashed through Lu Xuan&#39;s mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just refreshed by the Spirit Rain, contented, but feeling a bit crowded by the neighboring roots.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s this? Instant status of the spirit plants?&quot; Lu Xuan wondered, focusing on another Firefly Grass nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The progress bar was similarly almost filled, and a similar message flashed through his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The adjacent Firefly Grass is growing quite well, just feeling a bit overshadowed by the neighboring roots, occupying its growth space.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, there&#39;s no other way. The spirit field is only this big; I can only make do by adding more roots,&quot; Lu Xuan sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the growth progress and real-time status were incredibly helpful for him to understand the growth needs of the spirit plants, adjust the details, and expedite their maturation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gazing at the nearing completion progress bar, he was eager to cast the Spirit Rain Technique immediately to ripen the Firefly Grass. But he understood the dangers of overindulgence: excessive nurturing could be detrimental to the spirit plants, affecting the rewards from the white luminous mass even if they matured but lacked quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this realization, Lu Xuan&#39;s intention to hasten the Firefly Grass&#39;s maturity and obtain the luminous mass reward immediately dissipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he was about to return indoors, a thought struck him. He turned towards the west side of the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he could perceive the real-time status of the spirit plants, would the truth behind the black-threaded infested Firefly Grass also be revealed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He focused his mind on the Firefly Grass entangled by black threads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The progress bar showed no significant difference from the previous two plants; it was also on the brink of completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A message flooded Lu Xuan&#39;s mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Firefly Grass invaded by the Black Budworms is in a precarious state. If not dealt with promptly, its vitality will be completely drained by the Black Budworms, turning it into withered grass.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Black Budworms...&quot; Lu Xuan muttered, relieved of some anxiety. Knowing the origin of the black threads made things much easier; at least, he wouldn&#39;t wander aimlessly without a solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name sounded somewhat familiar to him. He hurriedly returned to his room, fetching a thick book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Common Pests and their Remedies in Cultivating Herbs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It detailed over a hundred common pests that might harm cultivated herbs, along with the author&#39;s suggested remedies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flipping through the pages, Lu Xuan quickly found detailed information about the Black Budworms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Black Budworm, as thin as a little finger in its adult stage, moves swiftly, and has a penchant for consuming the branches and leaves of spirit plants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When laying eggs, they stick onto the spirit plants. Once hatched, the larvae rely on absorbing the vitality of the spirit plants to grow. When the spirit plant&#39;s vitality is nearly depleted, they automatically move on to seek another target.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Solution: Only cultivators at the third level of Qi cultivation with expertise in attack spells can safely deal with the adult worms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The eggs and larvae are incredibly challenging to detect for lower-level cultivators unless their spiritual awareness is acute.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Due to the small target size of the larvae and their connection to the spirit plant, handling them easily leads to unintentional harm to the plant. Therefore, proficiency in certain specific spells and precise control is essential for resolution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan closed the book, contemplating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To avoid harming the infested spirit plant, the spells used must meet two criteria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One, they must possess sufficient lethality, and two, the scope of damage must be controllable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to his humble background and being at the second level of Qi cultivation, Lu Xuan currently only mastered two low-level spells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One was the Spirit Rain Technique primarily used for nurturing spirit plants, and the other was a defensive Fireball spell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he was only adept at these two spells and couldn&#39;t exercise precise control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, neither of these spells seemed suitable as specific remedies for clearing the Black Budworm larvae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spirit Rain Technique, initially meant for nurturing, would, in Lu Xuan&#39;s estimation, not only leave the larvae unscathed but might even stimulate them further...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the Fireball spell, while its destructive power was adequate, casting it would result in both the Firefly Grass and the Black Budworm larvae meeting their end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It seems I&#39;ll have to seek help in the market and spend some money to resolve this crisis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fortunately, with targeted remedies, I can save some resources,&quot; Lu Xuan sighed faintly, feeling the slightly deflated cloth bag hanging from his waist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lu Xuan, are you home?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brisk voice echoed through the door as knocks resonated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after, a grayish-black grass rope slithered from the corner of the courtyard, gently tapping Lu Xuan&#39;s knee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the grass puppet stationed in the yard, sensing an intrusion into the spiritual field and alerting Lu Xuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You waited until they were at the door to alert me. If there were ill intentions, you might not have reacted even if the house were being robbed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan looked at the retreating rope, unable to help but sigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voice sounded familiar, one of the few cultivators Lu Xuan had met since his arrival in this realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Coming, Big Brother Zhang!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He replied, walking to the courtyard gate and opening it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tall figure with a simple appearance walked in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This visitor was Zhang Hong, at the third level of Qi cultivation, residing next to Lu Xuan. He had a partner at the second level of Qi cultivation and a six or seven-year-old child. When Lu Xuan first arrived, Zhang Hong had offered valuable guidance, steering him away from many wrong paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Zhang Big Brother, please come in for some hot tea.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan led Zhang Hong indoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Hong glanced at the thriving Firefly Grass and Lunar Erosion Trees lining the stone path and nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lu Xuan, you&#39;ve tended to these spirit plants quite well. Looks like there&#39;ll be a good harvest soon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just average. Nothing compared to the spirit plants in your field, Big Brother Zhang.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Zhang Hong settled, Lu Xuan served him a cup of hot tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the teacup, two or three tender green tea leaves floated and swirled endlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Hong didn&#39;t mind; he knew Lu Xuan&#39;s cultivation and resources. A cup of tea with added spiritual essence was already quite courteous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Truly Clear Rain Tea, it feels like a gentle rain nurturing the soul. Only here at your place can one have such a cup.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At home, my wife doesn&#39;t allow anything like this. Dull.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Hong savored the effect of the spiritual tea, closed his eyes, and shook his head, thinking of the restrictions at home, unable to resist patting his thigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No way around it. My wife wants to prepare for Little Yuan&#39;s future, so we have to be thrifty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s understandable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Hong sighed, &quot;Sometimes, I envy your freedom, Lu Xuan. Being alone, free from the pressures of providing for a family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Living as you please, without bickering over trivial matters like groceries, not worrying about a child&#39;s growth or their cultivation path, not fretting about which sect they&#39;ll enter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So carefree!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you were in my shoes, you might long for a wife and child, the warmth of a family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan smiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You, young as you are, understand so much.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Hong chuckled, just a passing remark, steering the conversation elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I came to inform you about something. I heard from another source that the prominent Wang family in the market obtained information about a hidden realm. They&#39;ll recruit hundreds of cultivators at or above the second level of Qi cultivation to explore it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Think about it. If interested, prepare in advance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exploring a hidden realm?&quot; Lu Xuan pondered, lost in thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m considering going. Staying in the market and cultivating spirit plants barely sustains regular expenses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As for you, I suggest at least considering it. With the Wang family&#39;s foundational cultivators leading, encounters with powerful beasts or spirits are unlikely for us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most importantly, Lu Xuan, you&#39;re still young. While being a spirit plant cultivator is stable, resources are limited, progress is slow, and spending too much time tending to plants might dull your ambition to advance further.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watching Lu Xuan contemplate, Zhang Hong advised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan nodded slightly. Indeed, Zhang Hong made sense. Exploring the hidden realm had risks but remained within manageable limits. Moreover, new realms often meant significant gains. Even if he got the leftovers, it would take a while to fully utilize them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, he might have considered it. But now, with the appearance of the white light cluster, any slight chance vanished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venturing out for cultivation resources, returning to exchange for elixirs, techniques, artifactsall achievable through cultivating spirit plants at home!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safer, more profitable, and cultivating is so fulfilling!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretending to deliberate, looking conflicted, he eventually raised his head, expressing regret to Zhang Hong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Big Brother Zhang, I understand your kindness. However, I&#39;ve always been cautious, not one for risks. With my low cultivation and lacking exceptional skills, venturing out might lead to trouble with no return.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, I&#39;d rather stay home, tending to this small patch of spirit plants, quietly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As for the future, I&#39;ll take it as it comes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing Lu Xuan&#39;s determination, Zhang Hong sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Your thoughts aren&#39;t wrong. Exploring the hidden realm, while not overly risky, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s entirely safe. Even a slight mishap could cost lives, especially for us lower-level cultivators.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But I have to take this chance. Little Yuan shouldn&#39;t follow my unorthodox cultivation path.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two fell into silence. After a while, Zhang Hong bid farewell, asking Lu Xuan to look after his child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan agreed, watching Zhang Hong leave and closing the courtyard gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With the appearance of the white light cluster, I should avoid putting myself in danger in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If there&#39;s less than a ninety-percent certainty... no, less than a hundred-percent certainty, it&#39;s best not to venture recklessly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan glanced at the Firefly Grass and Lunar Erosion Trees by the stone path, feeling confident in his decision</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:44:08', '2025-04-16 05:44:08');

He gathered all his belongings, preparing to seek a solution for the black budworm larvae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before leaving, he retrieved a small stone, no larger than a fingernail, and approached the grass puppet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stone, pure white in color, emitted a faint spiritual energy fluctuation. It was a fragment of a spirit stone, split from a low-grade one, with broad utility for cultivators at Lu Xuan&#39;s level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Take care of things while I&#39;m away!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He inserted the fragment into a gray tuft on the grass puppet&#39;s head, emphasizing his instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the supplement of the fragment&#39;s spiritual power, the grass puppet emitted a faint spiritual light, seemingly revitalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though he wasn&#39;t entirely confident in the slow-witted puppet&#39;s abilities, Lu Xuan had no other choice. He could only hope that during his absence, the spiritual plants in his yard would remain unharmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once outside, Lu Xuan briskly paced along the cobblestone path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His residence was in the northern sector of Lin Yangfang Market, mostly inhabited by cultivators like himself, harboring dreams of self-improvement and altering their destinies, all crammed into a small area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the central market area, it belonged to the prominent families and powerful forces, a place Lu Xuan seldom ventured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a brief period indoors, he felt a bit out of place, observing the familiar yet unfamiliar surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A deep yellow paper bird, nearly six feet in length, carried a cultivator gently through the air at a low altitude. The bird&#39;s body bore varying lengths of feathers, indicating years of use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following that, a multi-legged mechanical beast zoomed past above Lu Xuan&#39;s head, carrying twenty or thirty cultivators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These multi-legged mechanical beasts were common transportation within the market. By paying several spirit fragments, one could swiftly reach the market center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outskirts lacked airspace restrictions, housing numerous similar spirit beasts and flying artifacts. Occasionally, a streak of sword light would dart swiftly across the higher skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sword light was controlled by cultivators using flying swords, signifying at least mid-level cultivation, an unattainable existence for Lu Xuan at his current stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan couldn&#39;t help but show a hint of envy. Mastery of a sword, traversing heaven and earthbe it in his past life or this oneremained a distant dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He composed himself and quickened his pace, arriving shortly at a gathering place for cultivators in the northern district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gathering place housed several shops and stalls, although they were nowhere near as grand as those in the central area, they were more than sufficient for a low-level cultivator like him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigating through the crowd, Lu Xuan swiftly located a middle-aged cultivator in a corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle-aged cultivator also had a second-level cultivation, slender in build with a prominent cheekbone due to his gaunt face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His upper lip sported a mustache, and his darting eyes quickly scanned the passing cultivators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan knew him as Huang, residing not far from his own residence. He frequented this gathering place, well-versed in the various news and connections within the northern district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, inquiring from him demanded a certain payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensing Lu Xuan&#39;s gaze, Huang slightly raised the corners of his mustache, offering a friendly smile as he approached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Long time no see, Lu Junior Brother. How may I assist you today?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan reciprocated the smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve heard of Senior Brother Huang&#39;s extensive connections and knowledge of cultivators in the north district. Could you introduce a few to me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have a few criteria. Firstly, they should be fourth-level cultivators. Secondly, skilled in powerful, finely controlled spells or possessing similar artifacts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lastly, they must be located within the northern district and available immediately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan conveyed his requirements to Huang, simultaneously offering a handful of spirit fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&#39;t expect to find higher-level cultivators, as hiring a fifth-level cultivator would cost more than twice the fee for a fourth-level one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the Firefly Grass was already considerably eroded. If left unresolved, he wouldn&#39;t just lose one or more of the Firefly Grass; he&#39;d miss out on the unknown rewards hidden within the white glowing orbs when the grass matured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang received the spirit fragments from Lu Xuan, his face beaming more naturally and warmly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are quite a few fourth-level cultivators in the north district, but meeting your additional criteria, there are only a few.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;From what I know, there are three nearby.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One is Fairy Lingyun, with significantly higher cultivation, proficient in the Red Cloud Needle techniquea remarkable offense and precision control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then there&#39;s Daoist Qin Ming, adept in ice spells but slightly lacking in offensive power, yet unparalleled in control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lastly, there&#39;s Daoist Li Xu, obsessed with swordsmanship and adept in transforming sword qi into threads, meeting your criteria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He provided Lu Xuan with the addresses of these three fourth-level cultivators. After confirming he remembered, Huang grinned and proposed, &quot;How about I accompany you to meet these three fellow cultivators?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senior Brother Huang&#39;s kindness is appreciated, but I won&#39;t trouble you further.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan knew this meant another price. He thanked Huang with a clasped fist before turning away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn&#39;t concerned about being deceived by the middle-aged cultivator; after all, this was his livelihood. He wouldn&#39;t sabotage his own business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back of the eroded Firefly Grass, invaded by black fine lines, rapidly developed a thin layer of frost, emanating bone-chilling coldness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensing the swift approach of this biting cold, the black budworm larvae attempted to squirm out of the leaf but couldn&#39;t match the spreading frost. The black lines froze along with the thin layer of frost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an instant, the snow-like frost solidified into hardness. With a crack, the shallow ice shards shattered, causing the black budworm larvae to fall alongside them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pale, tender hand reached out and caught all the fragmented ice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wow, Senior Brother Qin indeed lives up to his name, using the Frost Armor Technique with such mastery. I&#39;m impressed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan exclaimed, half in truth and half in jest, staring at the undamaged Firefly Grass leaves under the frost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The owner of the plump white hand was a chubby cultivator, smiling as he tucked the shattered ice into his bosom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not at all, while dealing with the black budworm larvae, I ensured the plant&#39;s leaves remained unaffected by the frost.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I observed the surrounding Firefly Grass for you, and I didn&#39;t find any traces of the black budworm larvae. You can rest assured for some time ahead.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;However, I noticed that the protective strength of your small spirit field here is a bit weak. Similar incidents might affect it in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plump cultivator, Qin Ming, reminded Lu Xuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan waved his hand dismissively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ll talk about that later. As for the payment for this task...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Six spirit stones and fifty spirit fragments, as agreed before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Firefly Grass wasn&#39;t worth much more than six spirit stones, but the substantial payment was mainly for resolving the pest issue in the spirit field and because Qin Ming was a mid-level cultivator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qin Ming wore</p>\r\n\r\n<p>an innocent smile on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan took out fifty spirit fragments, counted them twice, then retrieved six spirit stones from his waist pouch. He handed them over to Qin Ming, then turned away, muttering under his breath, &quot;Deceptive merchant!&quot;</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:44:37', '2025-04-16 05:44:37'),
(101, 30, 'Chapter 4', 'chapter-4', '<p>Upon receiving information about three Level Four Qi cultivators from Zhang Hong, Lu Xuan promptly visited each one, eventually choosing Qin Ming, skilled in ice-based spells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No other reason than it being cost-effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the three, Fairy Lingyun demanded the highest price, starting at ten spirit stones, frightening Lu Xuan away. Next was Li Xu, proficient in thread-like sword energy, asking for nine spirit stones. Qin Ming, however, asked for a mere seven spirit stones, the most affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation, Lu Xuan chose Qin Ming, bargaining on the way to reduce his reward by fifty broken spirit stones, saving half a spirit stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this bargain was only relative to the other two cultivators. Renting the courtyard with a spirit field cost Lu Xuan five spirit stones monthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just a short while, he&#39;d spent more than a month&#39;s worth of expenses, leaving Lu Xuan disheartened!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, he smoothly resolved the issue with the black budworms, hoping that the restored white light from the Firefly Grass would bring hefty rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focused on the Firefly Grass being eroded by black threads, a thought struck him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Suddenly shivering, feeling empty as if something vanished from within, urgently needing replenishment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What kind of state was this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan grumbled while his spiritual energy surged, threads of spirit rain falling onto the lush leaves of the Firefly Grass, seeping within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After three consecutive spirit rains, the depleted Firefly Grass mostly recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan then checked the small courtyard, ensuring the immediate state of the remaining Firefly Grass and two Lunar Erosion Trees was fine before entering the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early in the morning, Lu Xuan hurriedly approached the Firefly Grass without freshening up, gripping a leaf and turning it over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the persistent black threads had vanished these past few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He heaved a sigh of relief, a faint smile involuntary on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a round of spirit rain, Lu Xuan carefully examined the spirit plants in the field, finding three Firefly Grasses with their progress bars completely filled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His focus converged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ordinary quality Firefly Grass *2.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good quality Firefly Grass.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hmm? Good quality Firefly Grass?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan noticed the subtle differences between the three Firefly Grasses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After harvesting the first Firefly Grass, this farming cheat appeared. Hence, he wasn&#39;t aware of the quality of the first mature Firefly Grass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cautiously plucked the lightly glowing Firefly Grass, and three white orbs silently appeared, faintly shimmering, seemingly enticing Lu Xuan to pick them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Harvested one Firefly Grass, gained three months of cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Harvested one Firefly Grass, gained three months of cultivation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Harvested one Firefly Grass, gained the Earth Attraction Technique.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment of picking up the orbs, Lu Xuan felt a sudden surge of spiritual energy within him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wildly rushing spiritual power wreaked havoc through his meridians. Once settled, Lu Xuan sensed his cultivation had effortlessly broken through to Level Three Qi refinement, aided slightly by the three white orbs after days of arduous cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delighted, Lu Xuan thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As his spiritual power surged, a technique called Earth Attraction Technique also appeared in his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He understood much about the Earth Attraction Techniquea low-tier method similar to Spirit Rain Techniquea must-have for spirit planters. When successfully cultivated, it could manipulate and control soil structure and alter the concentration of spirit energy in the soil, facilitating better growth for spirit plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the present Lu Xuan, it was undeniably practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Activating the technique, the dull soil in the spirit field, under his control, slightly swelled, minutely adjusting the root systems of the remaining Firefly Grass, ensuring a more rational distribution, no longer clustered or spaced out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I initially thought all white orbs from Firefly Grass would grant three months of cultivation, but it seems, for the same species of spirit plants, they yield different rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That well-quality mature Firefly Grass bestowed the Earth Attraction Technique.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It appears, the remaining twenty or so Firefly Grasses, along with the two Lunar Erosion Trees, need more careful nurturing to improve their mature quality and thereby enhance the rewards from the white orbs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan contemplated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The courtyard wasn&#39;t large, occupied mainly by two Lunar Erosion Trees, while the rest of the area held a total of twenty-four Firefly Grasses. He&#39;d harvested four times, acquiring a total of four plants, leaving around twenty almost mature ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Firefly Grass occupied a small space, their roots spread widely in the soil. Even with just over twenty plants, it maximized the use of the spirit field soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging from the rewards brought by well-quality Firefly Grass, nurturing spirit plants meant striving for the best quality upon maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This way, he could sell more spirit stones and receive better orb rewards, a double gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With real-time insight into the state of spirit plants and aided by Earth Attraction and Spirit Rain Techniques, Lu Xuan felt confident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He decided to change his usual planting method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, he&#39;d sporadically used Spirit Rain Technique to nourish the plants and intermittently checked the field for any pest invasionsa relatively reasonable method for a low-tier spirit planter like him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now, with immediate knowledge of the plants&#39; state, he planned to shift from broad-scale Spirit Rain to precise, targeted care. He&#39;d attend to their needs individually, devoting himself to cultivating the best-quality spirit plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acting on his thoughts, he repeatedly employed Spirit Rain and Earth Attraction Techniques based on the subtle differences in each Firefly Grass&#39;s requirements, until his spiritual power was drained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observing every shiny, green Firefly Grass in the field, a fatigued Lu Xuan wore a contented smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for not having time to cultivate today? That seemed unimportant now; all he wanted was peaceful farming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After two days of strenuous effort, five mature Firefly Grasses stood before Lu Xuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, perhaps due to the prolonged cultivation period, the meticulous care over the past few days hadn&#39;t brought qualitative changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the five, three were of ordinary quality, granting Lu Xuan spiritual energy equivalent to nine months of his usual cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the other two well-quality Firefly Grasses, one also bestowed the Earth Attraction Technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After absorption, Lu Xuan felt a deeper understanding of the technique, shortening the time to invoke it and allowing for more precise control of soil changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It seems that if the orb reward yields the same technique, absorption enhances comprehension, like an experience bar.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan pondered, followed by the appearance of another orb reward from the other well-quality Firefly Grass in his mental space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Golden Sword Technique!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---------------</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:45:14', '2025-04-16 05:45:14'),

What an unexpectedly valuable find within this luminous orb...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan&#39;s mind momentarily wandered. He currently held mastery over three techniques: the Fireball Technique, Spirit Rain Technique, and the recently revealed Earth Attraction Technique from the white luminous orb. All three techniques were considered low-level, merely rudimentary applications of spiritual power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the &#39;Golden Sword Technique,&#39; despite being the lowest of the top-tier methods, left Lu Xuan utterly content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s essential to note that even among Qi refining cultivators, top-tier techniques weren&#39;t commonplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staying put, he concentrated his spiritual power following the mental route, slowly gathering it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, a pale golden stream, about three inches long and as wide as a finger, surged vigorously from within him, swiftly slicing a black thorn into two as it raced towards the stone wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan walked over, picking up a smoothly cut piece of thorn, secretly amazed at the slashing power of the pale golden sword energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the black thorn wasn&#39;t a spiritual plant, it was remarkably resilient. Lu Xuan had previously experimented with the Fireball Technique, taking half a moment to burn through the thorn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparatively, the Golden Sword Technique was significantly cleaner and at least twice as powerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;However, using the Sword Technique right after cultivation takes too long, reducing its effectiveness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With such a potent technique, I&#39;ll need to diligently practice in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, if I could unlock an additional &#39;Golden Sword Technique&#39; as an experience boost, that would be the best.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan contemplated as he looked at the remaining fifteen Firefly Grass plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He placed the harvested Firefly Grass into a jade box, planning another outing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He currently possessed nine mature Firefly Grass plants: six of average quality and three of good quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With limited space in the jade box and to prevent the loss of spiritual energy from the Firefly Grass, he needed to sell these nine plants quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, with ample space now available in the spiritual field and the remaining area&#39;s Firefly Grass soon to mature, Lu Xuan intended to use the earned spirit stones to buy some spiritual seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he had enough spirit stones, he might even search for a low-level defensive formation in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appearance of the white luminous orb in the courtyard increased the significance of the spiritual field. Lu Xuan feared that cultivators or beasts might sneak in, pilfer or harm the spiritual plants, thereby affecting the orb&#39;s richness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He instructed the straw puppet to watch over the house, carrying the jade box filled with Firefly Grass as he left the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as he stepped out, he coincidentally met Zhang Hong returning from the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lu Brother, where are you headed?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spotting Lu Xuan from afar, Zhang Hong greeted cheerfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hello, Brother Zhang. I&#39;m planning to visit the market.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan greeted Zhang Hong and learned that he had just returned from the market, having purchased several protective talismans in preparation for the upcoming exploration of a new secret realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you truly not wish to join us in exploring the new wilderness?&quot; Zhang Hong asked, unwilling to give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother Zhang, I appreciate your kindness, but my aspirations lie elsewhere. I merely wish to be an ordinary and content spiritual plant cultivator.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan waved his hand, firmly declining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In that case, I was hoping that with our mutual understanding over this long time, we could watch out for each other,&quot; Zhang Hong expressed regret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I wish you an adventurous and safe journey,&quot; Lu Xuan sincerely blessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, the two parted ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan walked to the market and noticed more cultivators than usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protective talismans were in high demand, healing elixirs were scarce, and as soon as they appeared, many cultivators scrambled for them. Despite the higher prices, these items remained in short supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It seems like news about the Wang family&#39;s upcoming exploration of a new realm has spread across Lin Yangfang Market.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So many Qi refining and mid-level cultivators are vying for a piece of the pie. I wonder how many will find opportunities, and how many will become stepping stones for others.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan sensed the restlessness in the market but remained unaffected, observing quietly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He spent two to three intervals in the market, paying attention to every detail and occasionally inquiring from the wandering cultivators. Eventually, he turned onto several streets and arrived at a herb shop named &#39;Hundred Herbs Hall.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shopkeeper was an alchemist with a significant demand for various alchemy ingredients. Lu Xuan had previously sold the spiritual herbs he cultivated to this shop, which offered reasonable prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering the shop, a strong herbal fragrance enveloped him as he entered a wooden house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The room was filled with all sorts of spiritual herbs, and a few apprentices were busy processing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lu lad, back to sell Firefly Grass again?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A thin old man spotted Lu Xuan and greeted him, noticing the bulging chest pouch he carried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, Manager He. Some Firefly Grass has matured, and I&#39;ve come to sell it to your esteemed shop.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thin old man was a relative of the alchemist who managed miscellaneous tasks in the shop. If Lu Xuan wanted to sell Firefly Grass, he had to deal with him. They were somewhat acquainted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How much do you have?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nine plants. What&#39;s the current rate for Firefly Grass per piece?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan took out the jade box from his chest and inquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s still the old price, three inferior spirit stones per plant.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Manager He, isn&#39;t that a bit unfair?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing the response, Lu Xuan retracted his hand, holding the jade box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;From what I know, many Firefly Grass plants cultivated by the spiritual plant cultivators in the northern district have suffered from insect damage lately, resulting in lower yields.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The news has spread throughout the market. The imminent exploration of a new realm by the Wang family in the central area has caused a significant surge in healing elixir prices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As the primary material for healing elixirs, Firefly Grass, even at the usual rates, seems to be exploiting us honest wandering cultivators.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You sneaky kid, your cultivation might not be high, but your nose is quite sharp.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manager He chuckled and scolded lightly before adjusting his expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One plant of Firefly Grass for three spirit stones and twenty broken fragments. Fixed price.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After contemplating for a while, Lu Xuan understood this was a fairly reasonable price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What about Firefly Grass of good quality?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manager He raised his head, surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve actually grown Firefly Grass of good quality? Let me have a look.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-quality raw materials slightly enhanced the success rate and effectiveness of elixir refinement, greatly valued by alchemists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Indeed, they&#39;re of good quality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re young and your spiritual field has sparse spiritual energy. To cultivate such high-quality spiritual plants is quite commendable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll purchase these three Firefly Grass plants of good quality for fifty broken fragments and three spirit stones each. What do you say?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan quickly agreed. As they</p>\r\n\r\n<p>were only slightly better than average, receiving an additional thirty broken fragments per plant was already quite good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He handed over the nine Firefly Grass plants to Manager He, who meticulously inspected them without faultfinding. He then counted out the spirit stones and handed them to Lu Xuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six ordinary Firefly Grass plants and three good-quality ones fetched him a total of twenty-nine inferior spirit stones and seventy broken fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lu Xuan carefully stashed them away at his waist, feeling the chilling sensation of the spirit stones through his clothes, his heart ablaze with excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>---------------</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:45:41', '2025-04-16 05:45:41'),

Such a hero is not only the sorrow of the Li Family but also the pain of the countless subjects of the Great Yu Dynasty!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Marquis of Xingwu, step forward to receive the decree!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A commanding voice boomed from the great hall, deafening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao struggled to look up, and saw many figures in official robes standing solemnly on both sides of the carpet. Was this&hellip; the imperial palace?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Great Yu Dynasty&hellip; there seems to be no such dynasty in history, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Li Hao was confused, a towering giant suddenly stepped out beside him, straight as a spear. Seeing only his silhouette, one could almost smell a lingering scent of ominous bloodshed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today, we confer upon the ninth son of the Li Family, Li Jun Ye, the title of first-class Zhen Guo Marquis. He is to be promoted to great general, given a burial in the imperial tomb, awarded ten carts of ancient treasures, three Yu Dragon Orders, and ten dou of gold!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As of this day, the entire nation shall mourn for three days, and the court will abstain from meat for seven days as we pay tribute to the valiant soul of the Zhen Guo Marquis!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such lavish rewards astounded everyone in the great hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only nineteen years old, and already anointed a marquis and a general!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While ordinary marquis were conferred titles like Marquis of the North or Marquis Pingyuan, the title of &lsquo;Zhen Guo&rsquo; to denote a marquis was an honor of eternal renown!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unprecedented and perhaps unrepeatable for future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, to be ennobled as a first-class marquis at 19 was incredibly prestigious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, on behalf of my ninth brother, I receive the decree and thank Emperor Yu!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The towering figure, straight as a mountain, a lance, knelt on one knee, and though his deep voice lacked much joy or excitement, it carried a faint sorrow, hoarse with strain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is what your Li Family deserves; it is I who owe you!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Marquis of Xingwu, that is your child there, isn&rsquo;t it? I wish to bestow a name upon him; are you willing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Without any merit, I dare not accept such a royal favor!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The young men of the Li Family are all heroes of Great Yu! As the Zhen Guo Marquis laid down his life for the country beyond its borders, and your son was born to this world, it may be the cycle of Heaven&rsquo;s will &ndash; Heaven has taken away My beloved general and bestowed upon Great Yu another fine young man.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I now confer upon him the name&hellip;?Hao!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I hope he will uphold the aspirations of the Zhen Guo Marquis to purge the world for Great Yu and unify Donghuang!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, this name is too noble; this subject fears it&rsquo;s too great an honor to bear&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No worry, the sons of the Li Family are worthy of such honor!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single name, Hao?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was taken aback, then almost laughed. What a coincidence, it happened to be the same as his own name?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The child they were talking about, couldn&rsquo;t be me, could it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao looked down and was instantly stunned; there he was in swaddling clothes, his little hands and feet adorably chubby, being cradled by a beautiful woman in military armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bring forth the dragon blood jade pendant for Hao Er,&rdquo; commanded a voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, Li Hao watched as a pale-faced eunuch with a solemn expression approached, carrying a dark red jade pendant etched with dragon motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A delicate, fair hand gently took it, and the beautiful woman holding him whispered softly, &ldquo;Thank you, Emperor Yu, for your generous gift.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is going on&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao blinked his eyes. Is this a dream?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, waves of dizziness washed over him, and he could hold on no longer and fell asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qingzhou City, the Divine General Mansion, the Li Family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Great Yu Dynasty had five Divine Generals, and the Li Family was one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With nine generals from a single family, all loyal and courageous, the Li Family was the nobility among nobles in the Great Yu Dynasty, bathed in endless glory and wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But beneath this boundless prosperity were the lives and blood of kin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six of the nine sons of the Li Family had perished!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The youngest marquis had joined the military for only two years and had just been promoted to colonel when unexpectedly, during the battle of Cangzhou, as a mere colonel, he led tens of thousands of cavalrymen straight to the enemy&rsquo;s royal city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He broke through fifteen cities and slew a hundred demons!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With achievements worthy of ten generations, he became the sixth member of the Li Family to die a heroic death in service to the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now immortalized in the Temple of Valor, he was revered and remembered by all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About three months had passed since the conferment of the &ldquo;Zhen Guo Marquis.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over this period, the people of the Li Mansion had gradually emerged from their grief, with a little less gloom on their faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;`</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And today, there was a happy event at the mansion, which brought rare liveliness to the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elite families and high-ranking officials from various states either came personally or sent representatives to Qingzhou, a procession of luxurious and noble carriages parked in front of the Li Family&rsquo;s Divine General Mansion, drawing countless passersby to stop and look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today was the hundred-day celebration for the seventh young master of the Li family, the son of Marquis of Xingwu, Li Hao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This favored child of heaven, born with a gold spoon in his mouth, had been granted a name by Emperor Yu upon birth, a name known throughout the land, and as he was from a family of divine generals, there was no doubt that he would have a place in the world&rsquo;s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the saying goes, it&rsquo;s best to curry favor early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the Divine General Mansion, in a room of the Mountain and River Courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao cuddled in the arms of his mother, Ji Qingqing, curiously observing the hustle and bustle outside the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a matter of months, Li Hao had come to understand that he was not dreaming but had&hellip; transmigrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was not a historical dynasty, but the Ephemeral Realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were martial artists, Great Demons, as well as swordsmen and temples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, the Great Yu Dynasty was powerful, demons were forbidden, and those daring to infiltrate the country were few, so the people lived rather well-off lives, not to mention someone born into a top-tier family like himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The days ahead were full of hope!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hao Er, actually, your mother didn&rsquo;t wish for you to be born into the Li Family, did you know that?&rdquo; Outside, the noise was lively and boisterous, but Ji Qingqing in the room wore a worried expression and suddenly said in a low, mournful voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao looked up at his mother in surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this moment, his vocal cords were not fully developed, and he couldn&rsquo;t speak. Even if he could, he would not be able to ask why, as that might scare the young lady to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, although Ji Qingqing appeared quite young to him, being in her early twenties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the meticulous care and warmth over these past months had made him somewhat dependent on this mother figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Actually, your mother had already thought of a name for you, it was Le Ping, Li Le Ping! Mother only wishes for you to be happy and safe, to grow up healthy. Unifying the world and such, that&rsquo;s the dream of the royal family, not the Li family&rsquo;s dream, and even less so of mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing murmured softly to herself, the sycophantic faces of the nobles outside did not make her feel proud or happy, but rather, she found them somewhat glaring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Emperor Yu named you in the hope that the Li Family would revive after the death of your ninth brother. The name carries the expectations of the Dayu royal family, and also serves as both an expectation and a spur for the Li Family&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said no more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This weighty expectation, placed on her own child, made it easy to imagine, the more favors received today, the greater the pressure to be borne in the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao looked at the sorrow between the young lady&rsquo;s brows; at this moment, she was no longer the awe-inspiring Seventh Lady of the Divine General Mansion, nor the iron-faced female general who struck terror on the battlefield, but simply a mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the ability to speak, he simply buried his head more firmly against her chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to convey his reassurance through his body heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling the movement in her arms, Ji Qingqing looked down, saw her child&rsquo;s long eyelashes and lovely face, and her eyes softened in an instant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She held Li Hao and shook him gently, her delicate hand soothing the infant as if to comfort her own heart:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No matter what, your mother will help you. Your father has already stepped into the &lsquo;Immortal&rsquo; realm, and there&rsquo;s a chance you will inherit that power within you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even if your talent in martial arts is mediocre in the future, with the power your father has passed on, it will be enough for you to catch up to the pace of your forefathers when they were young, and you will not fall behind your peers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No matter what happens in the future, Mother will always stand behind you and will not let anyone harm you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She whispered to herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The hundred-day feast is about to begin; why are you here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, the robust Marquis of Xingwu came over, his palm gently wrapping around Ji Qingqing&rsquo;s waist, and said in surprise, &ldquo;What are you thinking about, not happy?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing packed away her emotions, looked up with a smile, and didn&rsquo;t share her true thoughts with her husband. She knew that the men of the Li family were of a single-minded nature, taking pride in dying on the battlefield, and her own tender feelings for her children would ultimately not surpass the thousand-year glory of the Divine General Mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Have all the sisters-in-law arrived?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They have all arrived. They are just waiting for you and Hao Er.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Marquis of Xingwu glanced at Li Hao and rubbed his little head, but his rough palm was like a blade, making Li Hao roll his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t this pigheaded father be a little more gentle?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing, holding Li Hao, entered another room full of ladies and madams from the various courtyards, and at once a babble of voices surged up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh my, Hao Er is so handsome, even more so than Jing Er when he was a child.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, Shuang Er, look at your little brother, isn&rsquo;t he adorable?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yo yo, he&rsquo;s staring at me with his little eyes!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the ladies of the various courtyards, their children were also present. The youngest, only one or two years old, clung to the legs of the adults, their curious eyes round and shiny as they looked at Li Hao in his swaddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The older kids, around five or six years old, appeared mature beyond their years, not mischievous at all, standing to the side, seemingly bored, yet not daring to leave rashly, showing little interest in this new little brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come on, Hao Er, let Fifth Lady hold you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A beautiful woman picked up Li Hao, her face full of affection, and then exclaimed in surprise, &ldquo;Oh, is Hao Er hungry?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He just ate this morning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beautiful woman had no doubt and, thinking Li Hao was hungry, didn&rsquo;t worry further after hearing Ji Qingqing&rsquo;s response. She simply pinched Li Hao&rsquo;s little cheek gently, chuckling merrily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other madams also crowded around to tease Li Hao, and when the timing seemed about right, they began to present their gifts one after another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing hurriedly declined, but the gifts were firmly thrust into her hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were treasures money couldn&rsquo;t buy. Today, at Li Hao&rsquo;s hundred-day feast, the gifts received had filled half of the Mountain and River Courtyard, all of them rare and precious treasures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among them, a bracelet made of jade-like material was placed on Li Hao&rsquo;s tender little wrist by the woman holding him, Fifth Lady, who said it had nourishing effects on the spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao, who had been troubled by the chattering noises, felt somewhat drowsy; however, upon wearing the bracelet, he felt strands of coolness flowing from his little hand into his body, making him feel much more spirited indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sleepiness was swept away, and his thoughts became sharper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He squinted his eyes, and suddenly, blurry characters leapt before him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the muddled blurriness when he had just transmigrated, as the months passed and he grew day by day with his brain developing, these characters slowly became clearer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now, as if a nearsighted person had put on glasses, everything became crystal clear.</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:46:16', '2025-04-16 05:46:16');

He knelt on one knee before the Lord of Fazi Camp, urgently reporting:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My Lord, Northern Yan has erupted into chaos; Prince Pingcheng has colluded with demons and slaughtered Mofeng City on the border, as well as the surrounding eight towns. Emperor Yu has issued an edict, ordering you to set off immediately to quell the rebellion!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gazes of all the powerbrokers and the ladies of various courtyards within the courtyard were suddenly focused on the Lord of Fazi Camp, their expressions varied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao came back to his senses, somewhat astonished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had only been a few months, and there was already another war?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The smile had faded from the Lord of Fazi Camp&rsquo;s face, replaced by an aura of stern killing intent. His eyes were like cold lightning as he stared at the soldier before him, then slowly stood up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeming to sense something, he looked up at where Li Hao was, his gaze meeting his wife&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The murderous intent in the man&rsquo;s eyes suddenly dissipated, and he showed a look of regret, &ldquo;Qingqing, please accompany Hao Er for his hundred-day feast, I will be back as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing&rsquo;s face turned slightly pale as she handed over Li Hao to the Fifth Lady by her side. Looking at the baby in the swaddling clothes, Ji Qingqing felt an illusion, as if the child was seriously looking at her too, and there was a hint of reluctance in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was momentarily dazed, thinking it was just an illusion after all, the child was only a few months old, how could he understand separation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mother will be back soon, you must be good,&rdquo; Ji Qingqing gently stroked Li Hao&rsquo;s forehead, her eyes also full of reluctance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then she resolutely walked towards the Lord of Fazi Camp, &ldquo;This trip is fraught with danger; I will accompany you!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord of Fazi Camp immediately shook his head, &ldquo;You stay here and take care of Hao Er; he is still young and needs you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am a senior general in the army; the commander is in place, how can I be absent?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ji Qingqing&rsquo;s eyes were grave, &ldquo;Prince Pingcheng is crafty and cunning, has been biding his time for many years, and has suddenly made a move; I&rsquo;m worried there might be more to it, it&rsquo;s better if I accompany you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord of Fazi Camp stared at her, knowing his wife&rsquo;s stubborn character, sighed, and no longer tried to dissuade her, &ldquo;Alright, then please take care of Hao Er, ladies and sisters; we will be back as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You must be careful.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lady of the House approached, her face showing concern, &ldquo;You can leave Hao Er to us without worry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord of Fazi Camp smiled briefly, then turned and called out, &ldquo;Prepare the horses; Fazi Camp&rsquo;s elite soldiers, assemble and follow me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the General&rsquo;s Manor, actions were swift and decisive; they were accustomed to mustering for battle, and the couple quickly led a team of elite soldiers out of the mansion, rushing overnight towards the Northern Yan frontier camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That place was where the Li Family had battled for many years, and they were most familiar with the terrain, demons, and opponents; it was the Li Family&rsquo;s area of defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was because of this that Ji Qingqing was determined to go along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were too many prying eyes in the courtyard, and there was something she did not publicly say, why did Emperor Yu receive news of the rebellion in Northern Yan before they did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early winter, Qingzhou City saw its first snowfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a year had passed since the hundred-day feast, and Li Hao was now a year and a half old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His parents were still on the battlefield in Northern Yan and had not returned. According to the secret reports from the Li Family Army, it seemed that the war was in a stalemate and might turn into long-term combat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one-and-a-half-year-old Li Hao stood alone in the Mountain and River Courtyard, hands clasped behind his back like a little adult, gazing at the goose-feather big snowflakes falling from the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wondered how the girl who became his mother was faring in Northern Yan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house servants and maids around him were already accustomed to the young master&rsquo;s behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Li Hao had just turned one year old, the name of a prodigy had already spread within Li Mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since he was able to make noises at half a year old, Li Hao had never wet the bed again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While other children were crying and shouting, the little master was already using simple words like &ldquo;eat&rdquo; and &ldquo;poo&rdquo; to alert the wet nurses to feed him and take care of his bodily functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the age of one, while other children were just learning to walk, young master Li Hao was already running around, pointing at words in books, asking the servants to read to him, and learning to recognize characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t cry or fuss, was intelligent and sensible&mdash;that was the impression the house servants and maids had of this young master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Second Lady, the young master is over here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this time, a graceful and elegant figure of nobility entered the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing Li Hao standing alone in the snowy yard, the beautiful woman&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up, and she immediately scolded, &ldquo;How are you taking care of the young master? Are you not afraid of him freezing to death in this heavy snow?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surrounding house servants and maids were so frightened that they jumped, hurriedly kneeling down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The head steward among them nervously said, &ldquo;Replying to the Second Lady, it was, it was the young master himself who wanted to watch the snow, he asked us not to disturb him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The young master is still a child, is everything he says correct? If he told you to die, would you die?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Second Lady&rsquo;s face showed anger as she quickly walked to Li Hao&rsquo;s side, picked him up in her arms, and started patting away the snow that had accumulated on his head:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even if the young master wanted to watch the snow, couldn&rsquo;t you have held an umbrella for him? Dressed so thinly, I think you don&rsquo;t want to live!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group was terrified into a cold sweat, not daring to even breathe deeply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Second Mother, don&rsquo;t blame them, it was I who told them not to come over,&rdquo; Li Hao said, seeing the situation and feeling helpless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his parents had gone to the Northern Yan battlefield, he had been alternately looked after by the ladies of various courtyards; each lady treated him extremely well. The Second Lady Liu Yue Rong in front of him had a gentle disposition, but she was incredibly strict with the servants. Without saying so himself, the house servants attending to him could not avoid a good scolding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon hearing Li Hao&rsquo;s clear and coherent words, a flicker of light flashed in Liu Yue Rong&rsquo;s eyes, followed by a light snort:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For Hao Er&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;ll let you off this time. If I catch this happening again, I will let you taste what it is like to spend the late winter in a cold lake!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After speaking, she turned her face and said to Li Hao with a gentle smile and laughter, &ldquo;Hao Er, Second Mother will take you to eat something tasty. You, too, why didn&rsquo;t you wear more? Even with Emperor Yu&rsquo;s gift of the Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Jade, what if you get sick&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prattling on and on, her words full of concern, she carried Li Hao out of the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was already used to it and let Second Mother hold him in her embrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after, Liu Yue Rong carried Li Hao to the Shuihua Courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the courtyard, a child around four or five years old was swinging a wooden sword, his form so true to life that the swordplay seemed rather skillful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the Second Lady&rsquo;s only child, Li Qianfeng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his young age, his gaze held concentration and determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to him, a burly middle-aged man was instructing, nodding frequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao knew this was one of Li Qianfeng&rsquo;s seven military tutors, specifically teaching him Sword Dao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon seeing the Second Lady&rsquo;s arrival, the burly man hurriedly bowed respectfully, his gaze sweeping over to Li Hao in her arms, knowing that this was the Kylin child named by Emperor Yu. Perhaps after the talent is tested, he might not be inferior to his own pupil, Li Qianfeng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The child practicing swordsmanship did not get distracted by his mother&rsquo;s arrival, continuing to focus on his training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong didn&rsquo;t interrupt, giving the burly man a slight nod before carrying Li Hao to a pavilion nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the pavilion table were exquisite fresh fruits and flaky pastries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong held Li Hao, feeding him while watching her son practice swordsmanship, the light in her eyes flickering, and before long, she had become entranced, forgetting to continue feeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is the Li Family&rsquo;s finest swordsmanship &lsquo;Endless Sea,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao opened his small eyes wide, looking on curiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was said that this Second Lady&rsquo;s child, had his bone age measured and possessed an exceptional talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao wondered what it would be like when his own bone age was measured in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the courtyard, the five-year-old Li Qianfeng practiced with precision and discipline, even though he was only practicing the movements, his posture was correct, earning frequent nods of approval from the burly man, prompting him to praise the child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, no joy appeared on the child&rsquo;s face; he remained fully focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the burly man praised him, his teaching was extremely strict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The child began the routine all over again, his movements smooth, clearly having mastered them by heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao watched, entranced, when suddenly, a line of text popped up before his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have learned the rudiments. Would you like to record it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was astonished, and instinctively he chose yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Recording successful!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, a panel popped up in front of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Name: Li Hao]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Age: 1 year]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Cultivation Level: Mortal]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Sword Dao: Not Entered (can add points)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Skill: Endless Sea?Tide (Not Entered) [Forbidden]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Mastered Artistic Skill: Chess Tao]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Chess Tao: Level One (82/500) (can add points)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Chess Catalogue Collection: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Skill Points: 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than a year, Li Hao had been trying to figure out his panel, but due to his young age and not wanting to appear too miraculously precocious, his opportunities to test things were limited. Fortunately, he had access to a chessboard in the mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was half a year old, he lay on the chessboard and played by himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wet-nurse and maids taking care of him saw that the young master seemed to like the &ldquo;chessboard&rdquo; toy and were only too happy to have some relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s better than him crawling all over the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his explorations, Li Hao was amazed to find that by playing chess, he could, like in a game, gain chess experience and easily move up levels!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, to improve one&rsquo;s chess level was incredibly difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It required focus, talent, and hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Li Hao himself was only an amateur in Chess Tao, not even ranked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, just playing simple games on the chessboard, he was able to gain experience points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To go from unranked to Level One in Chess Tao, only 100 experience points were needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Level One to Two required 500 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the maids occasionally checking on him, which made Li Hao cautious about not being too obvious, he would have farmed even more experience by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no helping it; although these maids knew nothing of Chess Tao, they at least had some common sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they saw the not-yet-one-year-old Li Hao arranging the chess pieces all in their correct positions, it would inevitably seem peculiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But at this moment,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>apart from Chess Tao, the panel had added two new attributes, [Sword Dao] and [Skill], which were not there before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially the prompt behind [Sword Dao] made Li Hao both curious and excited. Could it be that Sword Dao, like Chess Tao, could be directly improved through skill points?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without much thought, he chose to add points.</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:46:50', '2025-04-16 05:46:50'),

She quickly showed concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao clenched his teeth tightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tumultuous thoughts in his mind gradually calmed down, and Li Hao then realized that his mind was filled with many pieces of knowledge about swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was as if he had been practicing swordsmanship day and night for two or three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damn, this headache, it&rsquo;s just like when Chess Tao leveled up&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao rubbed his head, panting heavily. He was still too young; his brain was not yet fully developed, and the vast information from Chess Tao and swordsmanship was a terrifying shock to his fragile brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without speaking, Li Hao was trying to calm himself down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is Lin Xue sick?&rdquo; Liu Yue Rong stroked Li Hao&rsquo;s forehead but felt no fever, and she couldn&rsquo;t help being puzzled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this time, Li Hao had fully recovered. He looked at his second mother&rsquo;s astonished expression, pointed to his mouth, and mumbled in his baby voice, &ldquo;B-bit, bit my tongue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong was taken aback and immediately breathed a sigh of relief and rolled her eyes speechlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao got away with it and didn&rsquo;t pay her any more mind; instead, he secretly started checking his own panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Name: Li Hao]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Age: 1 year old]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Cultivation Level: Mortal]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Swordsmanship: Level 1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Skills: Endless Sea ?

A monster?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing that his second mother wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to him, Li Hao&rsquo;s gaze returned to the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The children in the yard were still practicing swordsmanship, but through Li Hao&rsquo;s eyes, it no longer appeared as impressive as before. Instead, at a glance, he could tell the other&rsquo;s techniques were immature and their postures stiff!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it were someone who knew how to use a sword, they would only need a light tap to knock the wooden sword out of their hands!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; said the burly middle-aged man, quite satisfied with Li Qianfeng&rsquo;s performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excellent foundation and very good comprehension. In two more years, he should be able to reach dexterity with this first layer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should know, Li Qianfeng is still only a child right now, his brain not yet fully developed, so this was already quite remarkable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao watched while eating snacks fed to him by his second mother. Gradually, he began to feel a hint of fatigue and boredom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He yawned, nestled into his second mother&rsquo;s arms, and slowly closed his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something seemed to pass by in front of his eyes, but Li Hao had already fallen asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing the faint breathing in her arms, Liu Yue Rong looked down, a hint of complexity flashing in her eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when she raised her head to look at her son practicing swordsmanship in the snowy yard, the complexity in her eyes vanished, and her gaze returned to calm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stood up carrying Li Hao out of the pavilion, back to her own rear courtyard&rsquo;s bedroom. She gently placed Li Hao on her own bed, tucking him in carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her movements were gentle, as if she were his birth mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao, half-asleep, felt his body being laid down and became slightly more alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He felt warmth in his chest, a slight heat emanating from there. It was the Dragon Blood Jade Pendant given by Emperor Yu, which he wore at all times. This was also the reason why he could stand in the snowy yard without feeling the slightest cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Li Hao was about to turn over and continue sleeping soundly, he suddenly heard a low voice coming from outside the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Did you really feed that thing to the child?&rdquo; a voice of an unfamiliar man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It has come to this; I had no other choice,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was his second mother&rsquo;s voice, but it wasn&rsquo;t soft and affectionate, only as cold as one would be to a house servant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You saw it too, how hard my son is striving and that he is a once-in-a-century talent! The people from Mount Wuliang have already come to see, and when Qianfeng turns six, they will take him to Mount Wuliang to cultivate. When his Divine Blood awakens in the future, inheriting the power passed from his father, he will certainly become famous throughout the world!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I must pave the way for him!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao slightly opened a sliver of his eyes, the drowsy fog in his mind filled with confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was Second Mother talking to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know the child&rsquo;s talent; this action is too reckless,&rdquo; the deep-voiced man sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the door, a brief silence ensued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Liu Yue Rong&rsquo;s voice rose, colder than before, with a hint of mockery, &ldquo;As parents cherish their child, they plan far ahead for them!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to do this, but the wooden heads of the Li Family are beyond help!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Blame the child&rsquo;s father, if you must. How exceptional was that Marquis of Xingwu. Others may not know, but I am well aware that he had stepped into that realm by the age of twenty-three&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Which means, there&rsquo;s a not insignificant chance that his child might also awaken the Divine Blood!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deep-voiced man responded with shock, &ldquo;Twenty-three years old, and he stepped into the &lsquo;Three Immortal&rsquo; realms?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the Li Family ancestor was a founding Divine General of Dayu, with a powerful bloodline. Father succeeded in the ancestor&rsquo;s will, and he was the same,&rdquo; she confirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the previous generation, apart from Qianfeng&rsquo;s father, the Marquis of Xingwu was a monster, as were the third, sixth, and ninth brothers! Especially the ninth, who was even more terrifying. Fortunately, he died early and left no descendants&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The third brother&rsquo;s wife is always by her side, and being a girl, she will marry off eventually, so it doesn&rsquo;t pose a problem. The sixth brother also entered the Three Immortal realms early, but that was after his marriage&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong said coldly, &ldquo;The only one who can compete with Qianfeng is this child. Otherwise, why do you think Emperor Yu bestowed his blessing on him? Even if his martial arts talent turns out to be mediocre in the future, with the awakening of the Divine Blood, he can contend with the top geniuses!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside, silence fell again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deep-voiced man sighed lightly, &ldquo;Since the Lady has made such a decision, I shall say no more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry; this medicine comes from Mount Wuliang. After being taken, it leaves no trace to be tracked, nor does it cause any pain. I&rsquo;ve even coated it with sugar; it won&rsquo;t taste odd. Although he is still young, it won&rsquo;t leave any deep memories since children have too many sweets as it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Besides, if it turns out he cannot awaken the Divine Blood in the future, it can&rsquo;t be determined that we were behind any interference. Anyone in the Divine General Mansion could be a suspect!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Moreover, the bloodline of that realm isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to awaken one hundred percent of the time. Maybe the child simply didn&rsquo;t have it in him?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this, Liu Yue Rong chuckled scornfully, &ldquo;Thank the Northern Yan wars for this. Ji Qingqing, so deeply loyal to the Marquis of Xingwu, followed him to the battlefield, providing us this opportunity. Otherwise, if we waited till the child grew a few years older and they returned, martial guards would be secretly watching over him, making it difficult to act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man did not respond but sighed softly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, their footsteps gradually faded away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the room, Li Hao was now fully awake, his mind reeling, disbelieving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second Mother was going to harm him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seemingly protective and caring attitude of every day&mdash;was it all false?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was reluctant to believe it, but reality lay stark before him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he didn&rsquo;t understand what Divine Blood was, Second Mother, wishing to clear a path for her own child, perceived him as an obstacle and thus chose to destroy him!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao&rsquo;s expression was grim, his fists clenched tightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tender smiles had lulled him into a false sense of security. If this was how Second Mother behaved, what about the others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who else was sincere?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had been here for only a year and a half, but being cared for in turn by these ladies, Li Hao had developed some emotional attachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, however, it all felt like an illusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was this the internal strife of an ancient noble family?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He touched his body with his small hand. Besides a slight warmth in his chest, he felt nothing else, and even this warmth was from the Dragon Blood Jade Pendant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His mother had said that he had his father&rsquo;s strength within him, but now&hellip; it was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao clenched his small hand tightly in the dark, vowing to exact revenge in the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spring turned to autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the blink of an eye, Li Hao turned three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, he spent most of his time in the Mountain and River Courtyard. Being careful with the food delivered by the ladies from various courtyards, he sometimes pretended to be picky and refused it, acting like a capricious child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gradually, the house servants in the courtyard came to understand that the young master was extremely fussy about his food and drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Divine General Mansion, this was a crucial age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ordinary families start their martial arts training at seven or eight years old, or even in their teens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some, already set in their physical development, could have latent talents yet might not achieve great success due to missed opportunities during the best training period because of their family circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a martial arts household, the Divine General Mansion had the most rigorous training methods, with children of the clan laying their foundation from a young age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foundation Establishment at three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood Melting at four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bone Testing at five!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By six, it was time to formally train, not a moment wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the path of cultivation, thousands strive to cross, and an early lead often means leading at every step!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultivation aptitude was to be tested at the age of five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the bones were well-developed and the marrow rich and solid, one could begin training after Bone Testing at five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with the profound depth of the Divine General Mansion and their belief in not rushing, they prescribed formal training to begin at six, allowing the body another year to grow and solidify for smoother future cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even someone with exceptional talents like Li Qianfeng followed this, able to train after Bone Testing but still only ascending Mount Wuliang at six.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if practicing swordsmanship daily, it was still just the basics to develop a sense of martial arts, not considered real cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for those with average talent or delayed development, they couldn&rsquo;t start training, even at six, needing more years of growth, which could be at seven, eight, or nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with countless precious medicines in the Divine General Mansion to enhance martial arts qualifications, the mansion&rsquo;s worst case still began cultivation at eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard that this case was due to premature birth and prenatal injury, leading to such a result.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:47:18', '2025-04-16 05:47:18'),
(106, 31, 'Chapter 4 - 4 Levels Three, Six, and Nine', 'chapter-4-4-levels-three-six-and-nine', '<p>Chapter 4: Levels Three, Six, and Nine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translator: 549690339</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;`</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a sunny day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Divine General Mansion arranged for a military strongman to come to the Mountain and River Courtyard to help Li Hao with his Foundation Establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a short and stout middle-aged man with dark skin, yet he wore a flowing blue robe. His name was Lin Haixia, sounding like that of a girl. Li Hao later called him Uncle Lin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back with Lin Haixia was a little girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was about the same age as Li Hao, just two months younger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was said that she was the orphan of a comrade-in-arms of the Marquis of Xingwu, who fought on the distant Northern Yan battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the girl&rsquo;s father met with misfortune, he entrusted his young daughter to the Marquis of Xingwu, and before he died, the two agreed on a betrothal when they were infants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was speechless about this sudden betrothal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fine, you fight your battles, and it does not matter if you never return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But such a big matter, did anyone ask for my opinion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his irritation, Li Hao did not take out his accumulated resentment on this little girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the vast expanse of the Mountain and River Courtyard, there was now another small figure aside from Li Hao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The little girl&rsquo;s name was Bian Ruxue, and she had delicate and exquisite features, her skin fair and tender, like a porcelain doll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she first arrived in this strange place, the little girl was timid and shy, asking everyone she caught, where is my daddy, where did my daddy go?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The little girl was looking for her daddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no one in the courtyard dared to answer, and some of the softer-hearted servant girls could only secretly wipe away their tears in a corner upon hearing her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The little girl lost her appetite and grew thinner by the day. Seeing that none of the house servants in the courtyard knew how to comfort a child, Li Hao was annoyed. It seemed he had been too competent himself, not training these people properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had no choice but to step in himself, using a mixture of intimidation and coaxing to tell the little girl:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your daddy is hiding somewhere, and he will only come out if you behave and eat well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The little girl, with her innocent tear-filled eyes, asked, &ldquo;Is Xue&rsquo;er not being good? Why is daddy hiding from Xue&rsquo;er, and where is he hiding?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiding where?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao, looking at the little girl&rsquo;s pitiable expression, softened a bit and said a clich&eacute; line, pointing to the sky:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your daddy is up there, on one of those stars.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that point on, every night in the courtyard had a small figure gazing up at the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The myriad stars and their silver glow shone down, illuminating the solitary little shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the house, another little figure, who lay on top of a chessboard, would order the house servants every day to fan beside the little girl, driving away mosquitoes so she wouldn&rsquo;t be bitten all over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half a month flew by, and the military strongman Lin Haixia had prepared the Foundation Establishment elixir for both Li Hao and Bian Ruxue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of them underwent Foundation Establishment in the same year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foundation Establishment is the foundation of the Martial Arts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elixir for Foundation Establishment, made from countless precious medicinal ingredients, immersed the body every day, soaking in a medicinal bath to forge a body suitable for martial training!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the top elite families of Dayu, the Divine General Mansion had abundant resources. From Li Hao&rsquo;s Foundation Establishment onward, countless precious medicinal herbs and rare treasures were sent to the Mountain and River Courtyard, inexhaustible like snowflakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elixir for Foundation Establishment was divided into three grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common, rare, and supreme!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elixir used by Li Hao was naturally of the top quality, with a thousand-year treasure as the primer, supplemented by many other precious medicinal ingredients, capable of nurturing an Eighth Layer battle physique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once one embarked on the path of cultivation, one could break through the First Realm in just two to three short years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martial Arts is a crucible of money, and this top-grade Foundation Establishment elixir, used up daily, was costly to maintain for half a year to a year. Only top-tier elite families like the Divine General Mansion could afford to use it so freely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the yard, two large medicinal tubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao and Bian Ruxue were soaking in them separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the area around the little girl&rsquo;s tub was screened by curtains, with female attendants looking after her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These female attendants were different from maidservants; they had some cultivation and were akin to trusted aides within the household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Li Hao&rsquo;s side, Lin Haixia personally supervised him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, the dignified dark purple elixir was surging against Li Hao&rsquo;s body, his chin submerged in the liquid, leaving only his nose exposed for breathing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An indescribable bitter scent from the elixir filled his nose, like swallowing bitter lotus, which kept Li Hao&rsquo;s spirits acutely alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao asked, &ldquo;Can I drink it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better not to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elixir was potent, and the intestines of children couldn&rsquo;t absorb it; it could actually cause harm instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s for external application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Li Hao was focusing his mind, a string of text suddenly appeared before his eyes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Detecting unknown substance, analyzing&hellip;]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Analysis failed, automatically isolated.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao: ???</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damn!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be the kind of situation I think it is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was full of doubts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the medicinal tub, Lin Haixia&rsquo;s calm face was gradually turning grim. As time passed, his brow slowly furrowed into a deep &ldquo;chuan&rdquo; character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao noticed his expression and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a lurch in his heart. He asked:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Uncle Lin, is there&hellip; some kind of problem?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia wasn&rsquo;t surprised by Li Hao&rsquo;s perceptiveness. He had realized over the days that this little young master was more precocious than his peers, extremely intelligent, as smart as a five or six-year-old child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he was not in the mood to talk to Li Hao right now. Suddenly, he quickly lifted the curtain to check on the situation on the other side, and soon after returned to Li Hao&rsquo;s side, his face looking extremely ugly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Uncle Lin?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia reached his hand toward the edge of the medicinal tub, feeling closely, his gaze becoming complicated. He looked at the child in the tub, wanting to speak, but then the words stopped at his lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;`</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Uncle Lin, just say what you want to say,&rdquo; Li Hao couldn&rsquo;t help but say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia was slightly surprised and took a look at him. Although Li Hao was more precocious, he was still just a three-year-old child. Could he actually tell that she was hesitating to speak?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, her mood was so bad at the moment that she didn&rsquo;t think too much about it and just said, regardless of whether Li Hao could understand, &ldquo;When it comes to martial arts talent, besides the bone-measurement at age five, which can directly reveal it, it is actually hinted at during Foundation Establishment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The faster the absorption of Foundation Establishment medicine, the higher the martial arts aptitude. But Young Master, your absorption speed is too slow!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looked at Li Hao inside the medicine tub, her eyes revealing incomprehensible doubt and pity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, she thought for a moment and muttered to herself, &ldquo;Maybe today was just an accident, my refining mistake. I will check more carefully tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chill went through Li Hao&rsquo;s heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was that hint just now really about the Foundation Establishment medicine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you mean by &lsquo;too slow absorption&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s all being blocked, there&rsquo;s nothing to absorb!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was speechless in his heart. Was this panel going to adhere completely to the game&rsquo;s settings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had discovered this over the past year while exploring the panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there was no combat system in the game, it seemed that he was also estranged from martial arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or more accurately, estranged from practicing martial arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he tried to cultivate combat skills, it wouldn&rsquo;t give experience, only the arts defined in the game had an experience bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he could improve himself through diligent practice, in this case, it would be better to go back to pursuing art since it was more rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least experience would soar, points would be allocated, and one could create their own cultivation technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overnight, that would surpass decades of hard training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just that now, it&rsquo;s a pity for all these resources piled up around him. If fully used, they could at least nurture a first-rate martial artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which, since this extraordinary medicine that far exceeds modern elements cannot be absorbed, why was the poison before effective?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or was it not effective? Did I just fall asleep and not notice the prompt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe, whether or not I&rsquo;ll awaken the Divine Blood in the future, will be the judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that woman had said that awakening Divine Blood had a chance, not certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forget it, regardless, whether harm was avoided was due to your ability, but this bill certainly cannot be written off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose heart, I&rsquo;ll try again tomorrow. If it really doesn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll inform Lord Hou. He will definitely come up with a solution for you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Li Hao pondered, Lin Haixia reassured him, although she didn&rsquo;t know if Li Hao could understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao waved his hand slightly, ready to climb out of the medicine tub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Foundation Establishment medicine was being blocked by the panel, soaking in it any longer was pointless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up yet, let&rsquo;s try again. Keep soaking for a bit longer,&rdquo; Lin Haixia said immediately when she saw Li Hao getting out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao shook his head and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have to obey!&rdquo; Lin Haixia&rsquo;s face became stern, taking the matter seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was dumbfounded and could only say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go check on the little girl first.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he spoke, he lifted the curtain and came to the little girl&rsquo;s medicine tub, and immediately saw that the Foundation Establishment medicine that had been poured in, identical to his, was now almost clear water, turned from purple, with only wisps of faint purple liquid like mist still drifting in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Brother Hao?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bian Ruxue looked up at Li Hao from the medicine tub with a puzzled expression, being too young to understand discretion, simply wearing a look of incomprehension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Uncle Lin, considering the little girl&rsquo;s absorption speed, how would you rate her talent?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao didn&rsquo;t turn around and asked Lin Haixia behind him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia was feeling depressed and puzzled, but when she heard this, she couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. Despite being the same age, this little fellow always seemed so precociously serious in front of Xue&rsquo;er.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Her absorption speed is considered very good,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia had already checked before, and now her eyes reflected some emotion, &ldquo;If the Blood Melting at age four goes smoothly, then by the time of the bone-measurement at five, with the top resources of the Divine General Mansion, her warrior physique could very well leap to the Eighth Layer, and maybe even the Ninth Layer, ranking her among the top prodigies!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ninth Layer?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao was puzzled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia was patient with the young master of the household, regardless of his understanding. Since the child had asked, she, acting as a temporary teacher, ought to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After listening to Lin Haixia&rsquo;s detailed explanation, Li Hao finally understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out that Foundation Establishment, Blood Melting, and bone-measurement all together were known as Third, Sixth, and Ninth Layers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foundation Establishment medicine is divided into three layers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood Melting, into six layers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And bone-measurement aptitude, into nine layers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first to third layer physique would be of ordinary aptitude and considered lower-grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fourth to sixth layer physique would be among the elite, regarded as middle-grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A seventh layer is already termed a genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An eighth layer can make a name across a province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Ninth Layer physique is already the most top-notch martial arts constitution, belonging to the level of unrivaled geniuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such a top-tier constitution, breaking through realms would be as easy as eating and drinking, and they could generally reach the Fourth and Fifth Realm!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for higher realms, apart from talent, one also needs some other elements, like one&rsquo;s own understanding, perseverance, destiny, opportunities, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao turned to look at the little girl in the medicine tub, his eyes showing some astonishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will this little girl be a talent who will shake the world in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his mind, he pictured the image of the little snotty-nosed girl standing proudly among a crowd&hellip; and couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh out loud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia looked at Li Hao, her eyes filled with worry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed he was a child; he seemed clever, but after all, he was only three years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He still didn&rsquo;t understand the magnitude of what happened today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The likelihood that there was a problem with the Foundation Establishment medicine was remote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this also meant&hellip; he might turn out to be a martial arts invalid, unable to cultivate!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this family of warriors, especially being a son of the Li Family, unable to practice&mdash; he couldn&rsquo;t even imagine how cruel this would be</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:47:53', '2025-04-16 05:47:53');

Standing silently beside Li Hao&rsquo;s tub, she did not understand the significance of all this. She just quietly waited for Li Hao to emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, under Lin Haixia&rsquo;s insistent demands, Li Hao could only obediently soak in his tub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The color of the liquid inside his tub remained a glaring purple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The female servant accompanying Bian Ruxue glanced over and was dumbfounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As another hour went by, other house servants and maids heard the news and rushed over to take a look, all of them were shocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having been influenced year-round within the Divine General Mansion, they naturally understood what this signified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They looked at each other at this moment, each seeing in the other&rsquo;s eyes a sky that had fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The noble son of the Martial Marquis being unable to practice martial arts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the bloodline of the Li Family!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a thing was simply unbelievable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the reality was right in front of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole courtyard fell silent. Very quickly, a house servant snapped out of it, and, in a flustered rush, ran off. Before long, Mountain and River Courtyard filled with a multitude of brightly colored figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ladies from various courtyards arrived. They gathered around the medicinal tub and, upon hearing from the servants next to them the duration of Li Hao&rsquo;s soak, everyone was in disbelief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong stood in the crowd, her heart skipping a beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be that medicine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she had not heard of such a severe side effect from that medicine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her chest felt panicked, but she remained composed on the surface, her expression turning to one of urgency and sorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, within the tub, Li Hao, who felt life was no longer worth living, also saw the second wife with her outstanding acting skills. From her eyes, Li Hao even detected a hint of genuine panic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had the second wife been startled?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao sneered inwardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the courtyard grew increasingly noisy, the chief wife wore a stern face and ordered the servants to leave, only allowing the ladies from various courtyards to stay. She instructed that this matter must not be spread and must not be leaked!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing that the Foundation Establishment elixir showed no signs of diminishing, Lin Haixia&rsquo;s heart went completely cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This couldn&rsquo;t even be described as &ldquo;slow&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He thought of a terrible constitution and shivered. Could it be that the Lord&rsquo;s Kylin child was indeed a total waste who couldn&rsquo;t cultivate martial arts?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without continuing any further, Lin Haixia lifted Li Hao out of the tub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing how Li Hao&rsquo;s body had become oxygen-deprived and pale, his skin wrinkled and contracted, the ladies looked on with various expressions in their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They learned that Li Hao had been soaking for six hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the Foundation Establishment elixir showed no change whatsoever, highlighting the gravity of the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Yue Rong, seeing that even Li Hao&rsquo;s lips had turned white from the soak, was certain that this was not a ruse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her heart tightened, she had only intended to destroy the boy&rsquo;s Divine Blood, not completely ruin him!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, becoming a complete invalid would make the matter too suspicious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the powerful bloodline of the Li Family, unable to cultivate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the reason were to be investigated later&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first to snap out of it was the chief wife.

He obediently stayed in the medicinal bath, fiddling with his toes out of sheer boredom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time passed and the elixir stayed unchanged, the short man from the military completely lost his composure and let out a low growl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How can this be?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia was agitated, seemingly more incredulous than Li Hao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He paced back and forth beside the tub, striking his own head: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the elixir, it can&rsquo;t be wrong. Could it be that the Lord&rsquo;s child truly cannot cultivate?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the Li family bloodline!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao didn&rsquo;t feel too upset, after all, he had the panel and could become stronger without relying on these elixirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But seeing his teacher so distressed, he felt somewhat awkward and consoled him, &ldquo;Uncle Lin, it&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t be so sad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing this, Lin Haixia&rsquo;s body shook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He looked at the child in the tub and suddenly felt tears welling up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The child, you don&rsquo;t know what fate lies ahead of you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing the child&rsquo;s optimistic and untainted eyes, Lin Haixia felt as if his heart were being torn apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s only son, could this really be his future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, he could do nothing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Li Hao&rsquo;s case, he could only think of one possibility, innate meridian obstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the classic sign of a martial arts cripple!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it had happened in an ordinary family, it would be normal, as eight or nine out of ten commoners are like this, not an extraordinarily rare occurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is the Li Family!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Li family that produces True Dragons generation after generation!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the least talented children of the Li family are superior compared to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to mention those True Dragons of the Li family&mdash;aren&rsquo;t they all figures renowned throughout the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, this child&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Haixia was choked with emotion, rendered speechless. Even on the battlefield, where he could look directly upon mountains of corpses and seas of blood without changing color, at this moment, he dared not look at the child any longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those clean, innocent eyes were heartbreaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing that the man was genuinely sorrowful for him and was not pretending, Li Hao felt a warmth in his heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood up from the medicinal bath, pulling at the man&rsquo;s trouser leg, trying to offer some comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second Foundation Establishment elixir was declared a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news spread throughout the Divine General Mansion like a hurricane. With this, the news of Li Hao&rsquo;s inability to cultivate was solidified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The madams and house servants of the various Li Family Courtyards were all shaken and incredulous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following days, Li Hao no longer soaked in the medicinal baths. Instead, people came one after another to examine his body, but all left shaking their heads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Hao also took the opportunity to overhear them, learning that in their eyes, his condition was one of a Martial Arts Disabled Body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This physique did not completely preclude cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it would be exceedingly difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unable to absorb elixirs or external energy, one could only rely on grueling self-cultivation for a modicum of achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, one could only cultivate up to the Second Realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To break through, one needed to connect with the energy of heaven and earth, and thus the Second Realm was the limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news apparently reached the Northern Yan battlefield. Not long after, an urgent family letter was sent back over a thousand miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the information in the family letter once again shocked the Divine General Mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grand Marshal had actually reached the Three Immortal Realms!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter stated that the Lady of the House must not give up on Hao Er. No matter how arduous or difficult, she must see to it that he starts on the Martial Path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even just beginning would suffice. In the future, once the Divine Blood awakens, he could still achieve something. Although he might no longer have the potential to become a genius, he could at least secure a centurion&rsquo;s position in the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, he would not fall short of the name of a Li family boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lady of the House was from the He Family, named He Jianlan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He Jianlan, though over sixty, appeared only to be in her forties. After reading the family letter, she sighed deeply:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hao Er&rsquo;s fate is bitter, it&rsquo;s all because of that despicable woman.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody knew whom she referred to as that despicable woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the days that followed, Li Hao felt as if things had returned to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foundation Establishment was no longer necessary; it was said that when he turned four, they would try the Blood Melting for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, Li Hao, having nothing else to do, found even more time to secretly play chess, and his experience points grew quietly and rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the news of Li Hao&rsquo;s Martial Arts Disabled Body somehow leaked out and spread beyond the mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside Qingzhou City, the teahouses and restaurants suddenly had a new topic of discussion, but most people took it as just a storyteller&rsquo;s fancy and didn&rsquo;t truly believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, he was a Li family boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to some enemies of the Li family in the royal court, the news immediately caught their attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon sending people to carefully investigate and confirming that it was true, many within the family were both delighted and astonished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were delighted that the Li family, glorious for a thousand years, finally showed signs of a failing bloodline!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The astonishment was due to the depths of the Grand Marshal&rsquo;s concealment, having achieved the Three Immortal Realms long ago, and only now being revealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, his son was disabled in Martial Arts; otherwise, in the future, he would likely have become another Li Junye!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the blink of an eye, Li Hao turned four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a year of sneaking around and working hard, Li Hao had successfully entered the second tier of Chess Tao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also gained another Artistic Skill Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation, Li Hao used the Artistic Skill Point in Sword Dao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His Sword Dao was thus elevated to the second tier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the first tier&rsquo;s overwhelming barrage of information, the now four-year-old Li Hao could barely withstand it, only feeling a slight swelling in his head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the improvement in Sword Dao, the skills on his panel changed as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Name: Li Hao]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Age: 4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Cultivation Level: Mortal]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Sword Dao: Second Tier]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Skills: Endless Sea&middot;Tide (Perfected)[Forbidden]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Known Art: Chess Tao]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Chess Tao: Second Tier (0/1000)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Chess Catalogue Collection: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Artistic Skill Points: 0]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, after advancing Chess Tao to the second tier, Li Hao found that playing against himself no longer earned experience points; he needed to find someone to compete against.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:48:27', '2025-04-16 05:48:27'),

I must have eaten too much black-beetle flesh to evolve from it further. Zero points! When will I ever finish the first evolution and gain status.&quot; Han Sen looked frustrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over a hundred years ago, science and technology reached a very high level, and humans finally mastered space teleportation technology. Shockingly, when they tried to be teleported, they found that they were neither sent back to the past nor teleported to the future. They didn&rsquo;t even travel from one planet to another. A completely different world lay at the other end of the space teleport channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A world that human beings could not have imagined. In this world, all scientific and technological means lost their function: a machine gun in this world was not even as useful as a steel knife. Missiles and nuclear weapons would not explode, same as a heap of scrap iron. No mechanical or electronic equipment would work either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All kinds of horrible creatures inhabited this world. Human beings, who used to stand on top of the food chain because of their wisdom and technology fell to the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when people killed certain relatively weak creatures and ate their flesh, they were surprised to find that their own bodies changed considerably and evolved quickly in ways that science could not explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What made people pleasantly surprised was that in this world, with the evolution of the body, their lifespans also increased, which was amazing news to all mankind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following century, more and more people entered this world called &quot;God&rsquo;s Sanctuary,&quot; gradually became familiar with the rules of this world, hunted its creatures, and saw their own bodies evolve. The higher the degree of physical evolution, the longer the life. Theoretically, if you could continue evolving, it could be possible to live forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this world, science and technology became completely useless. The only things that could help humans were the most primitive fighting skills. Ancient martial arts, which were almost forgotten in modern society, had an unexpected effect here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All kinds of ancient martial arts had been re-developed, and after more than 100 years of development, new martial arts schools were formed and became prominent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to ancient martial arts, God&rsquo;s Sanctuary offered another tool to enhance humans, the beast soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When killing a creature in God&rsquo;s Sanctuary, a person had a chance to obtain the beast soul of the creature. Beast souls had all kinds of forms and appearances. Some could be summoned to fight for men, and some appeared in the form of armor or weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, some beast souls could even help humans transform so they could take the shape of terrifying monsters, magical birds flying between heaven and earth, or insects drilling underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither martial arts nor beast souls had anything to do with Han Sen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in modern society, advanced science and technology were in the hands of just a few people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen completed integrated compulsory education and entered God&rsquo;s Sanctuary when he turned 16. What he had learned from school was no more than the beginning level new martial arts that everyone knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for beast souls, they were so expensive that Han Sen couldn&rsquo;t afford even the cheapest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without martial arts and beast souls, or even advanced man-made alloy weapons, Han Sen was only able to kill some low-level creatures to eat their flesh and evolve, and he was having a difficult time in God&rsquo;s Sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the more meat of low-level creatures he ate, the less effect of evolution he gained. Three months in God&rsquo;s Sanctuary and he still could not complete a physical evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen had tried to kill some of the more powerful creatures, but even the weakest primitive creature, the copper-toothed beast, almost took his life. He had to rest for nearly a month before returning to God&rsquo;s Sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this time Han Sen had eaten all kinds of ordinary creatures around him, and it wouldn&rsquo;t help to eat their flesh any more. If he didn&rsquo;t risk hunting more advanced creatures, he would never evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was about to try to kill a copper-toothed beast, Han Sen saw something climbing out from the ripples of the creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He originally thought it was a black beetle, but immediately noticed something different: all black beetles had black shells, but a bright golden color caught his eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen gazed at the creature climbing out of the water. It really was a black beetle, but different from the ordinary ones because of its golden body as big as a basketball. It was like a sculpture carved from gold, and its eyes were crystal clear, like gems. It did not even look like a living thing unless observed carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why is this black beetle so strange?&quot; Han Sen stared at the golden black beetle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently he had killed countless black beetles and knew everything about them. Their vision was poor, but their hearing was very sensitive. As long as he remained still, even in close proximity, a black beetle would not notice his presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen stared at the strange beetle, and unexpectedly, it climbed toward him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation, when the golden black beetle crawled next to Han Sen, he held down the golden black beetle&rsquo;s shell with one hand and swiftly cut into its fragile joints with the dagger in his other hand. He made six clean cuts vertically and horizontally to remove all six claws of the beetle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The golden black beetle struggled and flipped over. Taking this opportunity, Han Sen pierced his dagger into a white mark on its belly and turned it sharply. The golden black beetle suddenly stopped moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sacred-blood creature black beetle killed. Beast soul of sacred-blood black beetle gained. Eat the flesh of sacred-blood black beetle to gain 0 to 10 geno points randomly.&quot;</p>', 1, '2025-04-16 05:52:00', '2025-04-16 05:52:00'),
(109, 32, 'Chapter 2: Ass Freak', 'chapter-2-ass-freak', '<p>Han Sen was stunned by the sudden voice in his head, and he could hardly believe it was true. Sacred-blood creature and sacred-blood beast soul: were those even real?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creatures of God&rsquo;s Sanctuary were divided into four parts: ordinary creatures, primitive creatures, mutant creatures and sacred-blood creatures. Different geno points could be gained by eating flesh of creatures of different types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, there were four God&rsquo;s Sanctuary phases known to men. With each physical evolution completed, access to the next space would be permitted. The more powerful the geno points used in evolution, the higher the likelihood of surviving in the next space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacred-blood beast souls were without any doubt the best beast souls. Any sacred-blood beast soul could be sold at an enormous price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Han Sen finally realized what had really happened, he was almost trembling. Holding the dagger to pick open the shell of the black beetle, he filled his mouth with meat as tender as jelly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Flesh of black beetle eaten. One sacred geno point gained.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling the flesh turn to energy and hearing the voice in his mind almost brought Han Sen to tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He grabbed a claw and sucked out all meat from it, feeling waves of energy hitting his body and boiling his blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was not much difference between eating a sacred-blood black beetle and eating a crab. After sucking the meat clean from all six claws, Han Sen started to cut the meat inside the shell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Flesh of black beetle eaten. One sacred geno point gained.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Flesh of black beetle eaten. One sacred geno point gained.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strange voice continuously sounded in Han Sen&rsquo;s mind and made him feel on top of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Han Sen was cutting away, he felt his dagger cut into something hard that made a sound like metal. Han Sen stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black beetles and crabs are alike: They looked tough, but inside their shells there would be nothing but boneless meat, so how could there be metal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He removed the dagger, pulled aside the meat that had been cut, and saw a corner of black metal. Han Sen cut open all the meat surrounding it, and soon the black metal was completely exposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first he thought it was metal, but taking it out, he discovered that it was a black crystal the size and shape of a pigeon egg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen took the crystal in his hand and didn&rsquo;t feel anything abnormal. The crystal was just like a beautiful, rounded black pebble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with a closer look, there seemed to be millions of stars shining in it, creating incredible beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Here is the easiest area in God&rsquo;s Sanctuary,&quot; Han Sen thought. &quot;Even primitive creatures are hard to find here, let alone sacred-blood creatures. How did this sacred-blood black beetle suddenly appear? And I&rsquo;ve never heard of a sacred-blood black beetle before. Black beetles are such low life after all. And this sacred-blood black beetle is so outrageously weak. Is its appearance related to the crystal?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no clue, so he simply ate all the rest of the black beetle meat and was stuffed. He gained a total of seven sacred geno points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven sacred geno points were beyond his wildest dreams. With his background, he needed to risk everything even to kill a primitive creature, let alone a sacred-blood creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shell of the sacred-blood black beetle was also precious material, so Han Sen picked up all the claws and stuffed them into his pocket, together with the upper and lower shells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shell of ordinary black beetles almost had no value, but the shell of a sacred-blood black beetle would probably make a soup that could give him one or two more sacred geno points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the first time Han Sen had eaten a sacred-blood creature. Technically he could max out and get ten sacred geno points: he already had seven from the meat, and the other three should be in the shell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he were to sell the shell, he could probably afford a nice private aircraft in Levo Interstellar Alliance with the money he received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back to Steel Armor Castle, everyone was pointing at him, gloating and laughing, and no one would come near him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone in the Sanctuary was looking at him as if he were a monster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, when an ordinary person went to the Sanctuary, even if he were poor, if his martial skills were not too bad, he could always find some companions and kill a few primitive creatures together, and he would be nowhere near as miserable as Han Sen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the entire Steel Armor Castle, no one was willing or had the courage to have anything to do with Han Sen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than three months ago, Han Sen had entered God&rsquo;s Sanctuary for the first time. The moment he stepped outside Steel Armor Shelter, he saw a giant white wolf unicorn standing with its back towards him around the corner of the rampart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen grabbed his dagger and fiercely stabbed the unicorn in the ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This stab turned Han Sen and Qin Xuan together into the biggest laughing stock in Steel Armor Shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the white wolf unicorn was not a beast, but a human like Han Sen himself. She was just transforming using a beast soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qin Xuan was also the most powerful woman in Steel Armor Shelter. She was likely to finish her first evolution with sacred geno points and embark on the path of evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new guy stabbing Qin Xuan&rsquo;s rear end became the biggest joke in Steel Armor Shelter. Although no one dared to mention this to Qin Xuan&rsquo;s face, secretly everyone was laughing their asses off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And &quot;Ass Freak&quot; became Han Sen&rsquo;s well-known nickname in Steel Armor Shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Qin Xuan declared that whoever spent time with Han Sen would become her enemy. In Steel Armor Shelter, few people could afford to be Qin Xuan&rsquo;s enemy. Even if they could afford it, no one would risk antagonizing Qin Xuan for the sake of a nobody and Ass Freak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was why Han Sen had such a difficult time, but he didn&rsquo;t really blame Qin Xuan. It was his fault in the first place: He was too nervous the first time he came to God&rsquo;s Sanctuary, plus he had never seen creatures in his previous world or transformers before, which all led to the unforgivable mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen was already grateful that Qin Xuan did not kill him in anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only lucky thing was that the teleportation into God&rsquo;s Sanctuary was always random, and there were no familiar faces in Steel Armor Shelter, so no one knew his real name.</p>', 2, '2025-04-16 05:52:18', '2025-04-16 05:52:18'),
(110, 32, 'Chapter 3: Sacred-blood Armor', 'chapter-3-sacred-blood-armor', '<p>Han Sen returned to his room, made a fire, and started boiling the black beetle claws and shells in a pot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without tools and know-how, he could only use the most primitive methods to process the shells and extract the geno essence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shell of a sacred-blood creature would take more than an hour or two to cook, so Han Sen covered the lid and took out the black crystal to take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, no clues whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, Han Sen caught a glimpse of the caged green-scaled beast the size of a civet cat in the corner of his room and suddenly had an idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like black beetles, this green-scaled beast was an ordinary creature. Han Sen used to prey on them and bring them back to cook and eat to increase his geno points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But later, green-scaled beasts no longer increased his geno points, so Han Sen didn&rsquo;t eat the last beast and forgot about it.

The beast, which hadn&rsquo;t fed for days, completely recovered its vitality, thrashing and scratching wildly in the cage, just like it had when it was first caught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen sat across from the cage and watched the movements of the green-scaled beast. He had a guess, and if he was right, he might have obtained something incredible&mdash;something more exciting than a sacred-blood creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Han Sen was afraid he was wrong, so he could only stare at the green-scaled beast anxiously, hoping to see the change that he desired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen nervously stared intently and did not realize that he was starving until he smelled bone broth from the pot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the time, he noticed almost 24 hours had passed.

It smelled so good that the hungry young man&rsquo;s mouth watered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About to scoop up a bowl of soup, Han Sen suddenly heard iron breaking from the cage of the green-scaled beast. He quickly turned around and saw the green-scaled beast had bitten off an iron bar of the cage and stretched out his head from the inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its light green scales had now completely turned a dark green color. Its teeth had become sharp and the tips of its four claws were like iron hooks. The beast was about to come out of the cage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen was pleasantly surprised and pulled out the dagger from his waist. He rushed to the front of the cage and stabbed the dagger into the lower belly of the green-scaled beast.

Eat the flesh of the primitive green-scaled beast to gain zero to ten points randomly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strange voice sounded in Han Sen&rsquo;s mind and left him stunned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Primitive green-scaled beast ... Primitive creature ... So the crystal can really make these creatures evolve ... &quot; Han Sen was overwhelmed with joy and did not know how to react.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a long time, he suddenly cut open the green-scaled beast with the dagger and uncovered the crystal as big as a pigeon egg. Taking no heed of the blood on it, he kissed the crystal twice and then wiped it clean, holding it in his hands like it was a great treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The crystal was really the reason the black beetle became a sacred-blood creature ... If the green-scaled beast had continued to evolve, could it have become a sacred blood creature too? &quot; Han Sen almost dared not think about it, because it was just too amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was so excited that his hands were trembling while holding the crystal. He bit his tongue and cried out of pain so as to know that it really was not a dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After remaining excited for quite a while, Han Sen carefully put the crystal away, gobbled up the shell broth, and gained another sacred geno point, bringing his geno point count to eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without tools and means, his primitive method couldn&rsquo;t extract all geno essence from the shell, but it was good enough that he gained one sacred geno point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen realized that he had gained a sacred-blood beast soul of a black beetle when he killed the golden black beetle, and he quickly accessed his profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen: Not evolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Status: None</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life span: 200 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requirements for evolution: 100 geno points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geno points gained: 79 geno points; 8 sacred geno points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beast soul gained: Sacred-blood black beetle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type of sacred-blood black beetle&rsquo;s beast soul: Armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What would the armor of sacred-blood black beetle&rsquo;s beast soul look like?&quot; Before Han Sen finished the thought, a golden shadow shot out of thin air, looking exactly like the golden black beetle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The golden black beetle flew to Han Sen&rsquo;s chest, turned into a golden liquid and started to cover his whole body. In the blink of an eye, Han Sen&rsquo;s whole body, together with his hair, was all wrapped up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The streamlined gold armor was full of power and impact, and covered his whole body as if it were a suit of gothic Medieval armor instilled with improved aerodynamics&mdash;it looked just like a piece of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole suit of armor felt full of power and speed, making Han Sen look slender and majestic, as if his whole body were full of explosive power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With shining metallic luster, the armor was gorgeous and had a solid texture. At first glance, it was even somewhat like the gold cloth worn by Golden Saints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between the gold cloth and the beast soul armor was that the armor covered the head and body completely, with only a few gaps in the joints where different pieces overlapped, just like the black beetle itself, which was the only weakness of the beast soul armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen moved around in the armor and there was no feeling of heaviness or clumsiness. Instead he felt that his body had become a little lighter and full of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Indeed, this was armor from a sacred-blood beast soul. It is way more gorgeous than the ones from primitive beast souls that I often have seen at Steel Armor Shelter.&quot; Han Sen felt ecstatic. He used to envy people in armor of primitive beast souls and had never thought he would get a suit of a sacred-blood beast soul one day.</p>', 3, '2025-04-16 05:52:44', '2025-04-16 05:52:44'),

With the black crystal, I will be able to do all that, and go even farther.&quot; Han Sen shook his fist, stepped away from the teleport station, and took the maglev train home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before he went into the yard, Han Sen heard a harsh female voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Luo Sulan, do you want to take the old house of the Hans? This house was our parents&rsquo;, and my two elder brothers and I each own a part. Now my eldest brother has passed. We won&rsquo;t bully you, since you are a widow, and will leave you his share. But if you want to take everything, we will never agree. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s right!&quot; The voice of a middle-aged man chimed in. &quot;The old house has always been the inheritance of our parents. All of us have rights to it, and you can&rsquo;t keep it for yourselves. Your family has lived here for more than 20 years, so you have already taken advantage of us in a big way. It is time to divide the inheritance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My brother has said it,&quot; a soft-pitched male voice continued. &quot;You lived in the old house for more than 20 years. We will not collect the rent, but this old house is our inheritance and has to be divided.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A young woman&rsquo;s voice could be heard saying, &quot;We have an estimate from a lawyer, and this old house is now worth more than three million. We are three households, so we should get a million each. You can either give each of us a million and own this old house outright, or sell the house, and then we all split the money. We are okay with either option you choose.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Exactly, now that our eldest brother is gone, we won&rsquo;t bully his widow and kids. You can give us money or sell the house, as you like,&quot; the harsh first voice began again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brother and sister, there is no need to force me. You know our situation. We don&rsquo;t have two million,&quot; a woman said sadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then put the house up for sale,&quot; the harsh woman immediately said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Where would we live without a house? Han Sen just graduated and Han Yan is about to go to school,&quot; the sad woman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sister-in-law, this is not reasonable. How are you the only one with troubles? Your kids Han Sen and Han Yan are only enrolled in integrated compulsory education, while my Han Hao goes to a private school. His tuition gives me grey hair every year. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sister, you are right. We are all having a hard time and everyone needs money. Why don&rsquo;t we just sell the house? We could all take some, and you could afford Han Yan&rsquo;s education,&quot; said the effeminate voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Anyway, you either give us money or sell the house. Your choice,&quot; the young woman said coldly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the house, Han Sen became furious as he listened. He pushed the door open and saw his mother shedding tears while holding his sister, Han Yan. The five-year-old girl curled up in the arms of her mother, her big eyes full of fear. Next to them, two men and two women were all smiling indifferently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How dare you come here and ask for the old house?&quot; Han Sen pointed to the fierce-looking fat woman and exclaimed in anger. &quot;Aunt, you used to be an accountant in the company and brought about tens of millions in bad debts. Did my dad not help you after you begged him?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Han Sen, what nonsense. Who caused bad debts? Stop lying,&quot; the skinny guy with the effeminate voice cried, pointing to Han Sen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Uncle, you embezzled the company&rsquo;s public funds to invest and lost a few million.&quot; Han Sen pointed to the skinny guy. &quot;Did you not come to my home and get on your knees to beg my dad for help?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And you, uncle, you owed so many gambling debts that you were almost forced to commit suicide. Who helped you? When you were almost beaten to death, who saved your life?&quot; Han Sen pointed to the fat, middle-aged man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Starry Group wanted to acquire our family business. If my dad didn&rsquo;t represent all of you and then had a falling out with Starry Group, would he have died in such a shady way?&quot; Han Sen clenched his teeth, looking at the four. &quot;But you, you skipped my dad&rsquo;s funeral and sold the company to Starry Group upon his death. Did you give us any of the money you got from selling the company? Also, who paid for YOUR houses when you got married? Were those houses any cheaper than this old house? Did you take care of your parents for a single day when they were alive? How dare you come here to ask for a share of the old house?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stop it! Your father only did what he wanted to do. The company belonged to my father, and we all have shares. He can&rsquo;t decide for us. And surely, we can spend the money of the company,&quot; Uncle Han Lei said brazenly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s true. Your father was a dictator, and we are only getting our own money back. It does not matter what you say. Give the money or sell the house, otherwise we&rsquo;ll see you in court. You will lose the case wherever we go,&quot; Aunt Han Yumei shouted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s all your dad&rsquo;s fault ... &quot; They started to accuse Han Sen&rsquo;s late father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen was shaking with anger and felt wronged for his father. When his father took over the company, it was only a small business, worth one or two million. He spent so much effort for the company to bloom and had to look after his family and make up for their mistakes. A few times the company was on the brink of bankruptcy due to liquidity problems. And he even died for the company. After his death, however, his wife and children were bullied by the relatives that he used to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Han Sen&rsquo;s father was alive, he always said that they were family and there&rsquo;s no need to argue. And what an irony it has become now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they truly needed the money and had difficulties, Han Sen would just agree to give it. But all the private aircrafts they piloted here were worth more than a million. And they at least got ten million from selling the company, which all fell into their pockets, and nothing was given to Han Sen&rsquo;s family. It was simply impossible that they didn&rsquo;t even have a million.</p>', 4, '2025-04-16 05:53:08', '2025-04-16 05:53:08');

When Han Sen&rsquo;s father was still alive, she was treated like a princess. She didn&rsquo;t even know how to sweep the floor, let alone do other chores. Han Sen knew how difficult it was for her to raise his sister and him after his father passed away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mom. I am here even though Dad isn&rsquo;t. I will not let them take away our house. You take a rest and I&rsquo;ll consult Uncle Zhang on the matter.&quot; Han Sen called a friend of his father&rsquo;s, Mr. Zhang. He was the lawyer who used to work in their family business as legal counsel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hi, Uncle Zhang? This is Sen ... Is your back any better? I have a legal matter that I want to ask you about ... so ... &quot; Han Sen looked a little pale when he hung up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had confirmed that his relative told the truth&mdash;they do have rights to a part of the house. And if they really did go to court, the verdict would be close to what they&rsquo;ve asked for&mdash;to either pay them money or sell the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sen, what did Mr. Zhang say?&quot; Luo Sulan asked Han Sen, looking at him nervously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Mom. I have checked with Uncle Zhang and there is a solution. You just make sure Yan is okay, and I&rsquo;ll take care of this. The house will not be taken away by anyone,&quot; Han Sen said with a smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s good ... that&rsquo;s great ... &quot; Luo Sulan breathed a sigh of relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having rested at home for a night, Han Sen took a train to the teleport station and entered God&rsquo;s Sanctuary in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen was teleported to his room at the Steel Armor Shelter. When one was teleported into God&rsquo;s Sanctuary, one would appear in a certain room only accessible to him or her. Unless permitted by the owner, others were not able to enter the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before finishing the first evolution and entering Second God&rsquo;s Sanctuary, this was Han Sen&rsquo;s home in God&rsquo;s Sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Han Sen had no power or influence. The only solution was to come up with two million dollars in a month if he wanted to keep the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he felt it was unfair, without power, there was nothing left to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two million Levo dollars was an enormous amount for a young man who just finished integrated compulsory education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, Han Sen couldn&rsquo;t have earned two million in a year, let alone in a month. But now everything was different. In fact, if he had not already cooked the shell of the sacred-blood black beetle, the shell alone would be worth one or two million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even without the shell, he still had the black crystal that could make creatures evolve. As long as he had that, two million was nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the body of the primitive green-scaled beast on the ground, Han Sen hesitated for a moment before cutting the body into pieces. He then dried the meat, made it into beef jerky and carried it with him in his waist pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He must first catch a creature before he could use the crystal to make it evolve and trade the flesh of the evolved creature for money. Now that Han Sen owned a suit of sacred-blood-beast soul armor, he could up his game and start to hunt primitive creatures instead of ordinary creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitive creatures weren&rsquo;t worth much, and he would waste a day&rsquo;s time waiting for an ordinary creature to evolve into a primitive one. To come up with two million, Han Sen would need to sell at least a mutant creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primitive creatures were usually seen a dozen kilometers from Steel Armor Shelter. Han Sen had not dared to go that far before, but now he his had his armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, his goal was no longer a copper toothed beast, the weakest among all primitive creatures, but the swift mantis often spotted in Zephyr Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although a primitive creature, a swift mantis had a fragile body and could easily be killed by a normal alloy dagger if stabbed in a vulnerable spot. However, a swift mantis was so fast that ordinary people couldn&rsquo;t keep up with it. And its pair of hacksaw-like forelegs could easily split human bones. Once hit by the forelegs, a person would be crippled, if not killed. So few humans would go to hunt this creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Han Sen, however, the swift mantis was the best option. It was in the end only a primitive creature, and there was no way it could cut open his sacred-blood-beast soul armor. If he couldn&rsquo;t be hurt by the mantis, surely he could kill it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing was that with claws and wings cut off, a swift mantis could no longer fight back but could still live. This way, Han Sen could easily take it back, keep it in his room, and use the black crystal to make it evolve into a mutant creature before he sold its flesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, if he were able kill a few swift mantises and got lucky, he might even gain a beast soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beast soul of a swift mantis was in the shape of a swift jagged blade, which was a long dagger, a type of weapon Han Sen had mastered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the swift jagged blade was only a primitive beast soul weapon, it was the sharpest of all primitive weapons, and could even compare to some mutant beast soul weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the danger of hunting swift mantises, few would go to Zephyr Valley, and even fewer had obtained a swift jagged blade. If the rare weapon were to be sold, it would cost more than two million. So, if Han Sen could score a beast soul of a swift mantis, there would be no need to sell mutant creature flesh any more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closer Han Sen got to Zephyr Valley, the fewer people he could see. Around the valley, there was no human activity at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen did not dare to go too deep, so he found a hidden place and summoned the sacred-blood black beetle beast soul to cover himself in the golden armor. Taking a deep breath, he sneaked towards Zephyr Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Sen did not dare to go too fast. The valley was covered with trees and wild grass as tall as a man.

Can you send me back?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grim Reaper, unable to understand what was happening, nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believed Neo, inexperienced in the Revival ritual, might&#39;ve mistakenly sacrificed himself again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We will send you back, but please, do not return by mistake again. Death is not a child&#39;s toy. The Living should not touch it too many times.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grim Reaper decided to forgive Neo for the mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, he carried the bloodline of the Great God Hades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was royalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then, goodbye, O Child of Monarch. We wish you a blessed life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The black clouds rushed out of the Grim Reaper and sent Neo&#39;s soul back to his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Unique Skill Exp +1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Unique Skill: Death (2/10)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He woke up with a groan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The water splashed inside the pond, making him slightly cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brrr&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I should finish it quickly or I might catch cold with this dammed weak body.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He dived into the pond and used the Death skill for the third time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The familiar sensation passed through his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Again?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We hope we are wrong but&hellip;. O Child of Monarch, are you doing this on purpose?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as Neo woke up on the beach, he came to face an angered the Grim Reaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flames in the Grim Reaper&#39;s eyes flared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you dare belittle Death? Even if you are the Child of Monarch, you are not above Death!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chill crawled up Neo&#39;s spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The air turned heavy and it was crushing Neo under its weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo&#39;s legs started to shake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His teeth clattered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, his eyes remained calm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was not an ounce of fear in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stared at the Grim Reaper without backing down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grim Reaper calmed down after watching Neo&#39;s expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&hellip;.What is it, O Child of Monarch? Do you have something to say?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m training.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Train&hellip;ing?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo pursed his lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Didn&#39;t you say it yourself? I&#39;m the child of the Great God Hades, the God who rules over Death.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about Death. How can the son of the Great God Hades don&#39;t know about his domain? It&#39;s insulting to him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, I&#39;m trying to learn about Death by experiencing it myself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His words pierced the Grim Reaper&#39;s heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grim Reaper&#39;s body trembled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just when Neo thought he was going to attack, he got on one knee and bowed,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We apologize for being unable to understand you intentions, O Child of Monarch! W-we&hellip; You were looking far ahead, and yet we dared to shout at you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Please, allow us to pay for this unforgivable sin by sacrificing our life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grim Reaper raised its arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cloud of darkness oozed out and transformed into a pitch-black scythe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scythe was about to behead the Grim Reaper when Neo spoke,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stop it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took a step and stood before the Grim Reaper, looking down at him with his crimson eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You were doing your job. I&#39;m happy you stood up for your principles even if you had to face me, a child of your Master.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;O Child of&mdash;&quot; The Grim Reaper choked on his words. &quot;O Great Child of the Monarch, we thank thee for thy generosity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way the Grim Reaper addressed him changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It meant he finally accepted Neo as the kin of Hades and a fellow being of Death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stand up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo helped the Grim Reaper to his feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he touched its cloak, a chilling cold permeated into his body through his fingers. He barely kept his face straight and managed to not make a fool of himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, can you send me back?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can but&hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is there a problem?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, however, O Great Child of the Monarch, while you have not broken any rules, you have repeadetely touched Death with your soul.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t allow your soul to rest, you will lose your emotions and your soul will be corrupted.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When that happens, I won&#39;t be able to send you back to the realm of living.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo found it hard to believe the Grim Reaper&#39;s words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he knew the Grim Reaper had no reason to lie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, Neo had not read the last volume where the Gods were introduced, and his knowledge of this world was not omnipotent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had to be careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just now, he had come too close to his true death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thought of spending an Eternity in the Underworld sent chills down his spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noticing Neo&#39;s expressionless face, the Grim Reaper knew he was beginning to change. He was too calm after hearing the devastating news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Grim Reaper did not feel the change was bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a great change in its eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The son of the Great God Hades should have such qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He should not fear Death, and instead unearth the method to control it. Just like Neo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Maybe if it&#39;s him, he can accomplish what the other children of the Monarch failed to do.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many children of Hades had been a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Neo could prove himself worthy, the Grim Reaper thought it would not be bad to invest in him.</p>', 5, '2025-04-16 05:56:12', '2025-04-16 05:56:12');

Read more Upon awakening, Lu Xuan found himself as an ordinary spirit plant cultivator, tending to an acre of land merely scraping by in the realm of cultivation.Fortunately, he stumbled upon an unexpected revelation: with each maturing spiritual plant, he received additional rewards.Harvesting a The Firefly Grass yielded a Golden Sword Technique.From the Blood-Devouring Vine, he obtained a Purification Talisman.And the Phantom Spring Flower gifted him a prescription for the elusive Luminous Flame Pill.Henceforth, he contentedly tended to his own spiritual fields, observing the tumultuous tides and shifts in the world of cultivation.&ldquo;Duels and clashes, expeditions into secret realms, immortal fortunes, obtaining mystical treasures&hellip; None of it concerns me!&rdquo;&ldquo;I simply wish for peace and quiet to tend to my fields.&rdquo; Collapse Accelerated Growth, Artifacts, Cautious Protagonist, Cultivation, Evil Protagonist, Farming, Fast Cultivation, Magic Beasts, Magic Formations, Male Protagonist, Pill Based Cultivation, Transmigration, Weak to Strong The novel has surprised me some. It was unexpectedly good.The MC is smart and careful. He downplays his strength publicly so he is not suspected of acting against those who provoke him. It deters the sect from sending him away from his fields to combat missions. He often secretly kills those who cross him.It&#39;s one of those novels where the MC gets system rewards from harvesting plants he raises himself. He ingratiates himself in the sect with his knowledge of plants and beasts. The closest comparison is &quot;top tier providence&quot; but Lu Xuan is not OP like Han Jue. He is average in every way except for his cheat. He overwhelms his opponents in seconds with his system given wealth.Like many of the genre, there are sects, clans that specialize in sales, evil cultivators, and even demonic invasions into the continent. The MC sometimes travels or is sent in missions, though most of the &quot;down time&quot; working his fields is merely summarized by the author until harvest time. A pity really, I&#39;d like to read much more detailed writing about how Lu Xuan takes care of each and every plant :D The MC eventually joins a sect and we see that sect life arc. SpoilerUntil the demons invade and the biggest sects are unable to resist them, so they disband and the core leadership flees, abandoning their juniors. Then like others in the genre, there is travel to a stronger cultivation area from the &quot;starter continent&quot;.I&#39;ll give it a 4/5. I just caught up with ch 639 on the mtl. Balance Yo it&#39;s a pretty funny novel at times and it&#39;s also good, in the mtl at least. Yesterday, I read about 30 chapters of this webnovel.The cultivation progress feels painfully slow. Within these 30 chapters, the MC has only advanced from Qi Cultivation Stage 2 to Stage 4. The system can reward &quot;months of cultivation progress,&quot; yet it rarely gives them out. Single-use Talismans are increasingly emphasized, with the MC continuously praising their usefulness. However, in my opinion, if the MC&#39;s cultivation level surpasses that of their enemy, they could simply overpower them without relying on these talismans. The pacing of the story is sluggish, making it quite boring. Ultimately, I decided to drop it. This is a realistic low power level storyIt&#39;s different from what u are seeking, that doesn&#39;t make it bad.It&#39;s exploring each stage and the dynamics of low power level cultivation world and society is refreshing.The caution excercised is within level and beautifully managed to portray the struggles of a qi apprenticeWhich are majority of the cultivators in the world. Slow pace itself doesn&#39;t make something bad. There are many slow-burn novels, like &#39;Mortal&#39;s Journey to Immortality,&#39; that beautifully showcase growth.It is actually a broken promise that sours a novel.The way the system is depicted resembles those fast-paced modern cultivation novels. It is natural to expect fast growth from the synopsis and initial chapters. However, the author deceived the readers into reading something else. They could have made a slow-paced novel without the system. It&#39;s like those clickbait thumbnail YouTube videos. Ur kinda true tbh I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s good, I have yearned long enough for a farming novel you farm, i sleep Balance Why is this tagged as evil mc? I&#39;m 14 chaps seen and I&#39;ve seen this nigga do everything a good mc does. He isn&#39;t evil at all. But he secretly raises &quot;evil&quot; plants and possesses &quot;evil&quot; items that the system rewarded him with for harvesting them.He doesn&#39;t mess with people at all, and ignores people disrespecting him - because he downplays his strength in the first place. He does secretly kill those who step over the line though, and often harvest their bodies or souls to feed his plants. That Is literally what this is about farming and u get mad at the author for actually doing what he said his main character was going to do farmI rather have this than those novels where the main character does it at the beginning then immediately goes to fighting everybody after he&rsquo;s strong enough and that&rsquo;s like 10 chapters he will only work to get something for others or it will be a quest from his system As the King of Grinding, the player faced Lu Xuan.The player asked Lu Xuan, &quot;Are you a cultivator because you farm? Or are you a farmer because you cultivate?&quot;The player began to open their domain &#39;Reload Save&#39; and rewinded time itself to a previously set point until they could approach Lu Xuan&#39;s realm of cultivation.However, Lu Xuan cultivates nowhere, and by voice stabilization technique he simply stated:&quot;Stand proud, you&#39;e strong,&quot;But,&quot;Nah, I&#39;d win.&quot;The player&#39;s domain crumpled.In their final moments, the player uttered the phrase,&quot;With this treasure I summon...&quot;Because in novels of cultivation, always bet on the Plot Armor. The battle was trivially concluded, and those who pioneered the techniques of cheats, the ones who manifested the golden finger, they would all bear witness to the bare flesh of the one who is free. Lobotomy kaisen has invaded deep &quot;Are you strong because you&#39;re nah id win or did you leave it all behind and stand proud because with this treasure I summon always bet on Hakari.
